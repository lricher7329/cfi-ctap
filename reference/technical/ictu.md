## **First Nations Health Consortium and Data Governance**

The First Nations Health Consortium plays a central role in relationship-building and trust-based governance rather than simply acting as a service provider. Its primary function is to establish and steward relationships with First Nations communities, positioning itself as a **trusted intermediary and trustee** for health-related data. This trustee role is critical: the consortium is not merely hosting data, but is accountable to communities for how data are collected, accessed, interpreted, and used.

A major challenge within the current provincial digital health ecosystem—particularly within **Connect Care**—is the absence of Indigenous identifiers. Without these identifiers, it is difficult to accurately understand health outcomes, service utilization, or inequities affecting First Nations communities. This creates both analytic blind spots and governance risks, as communities cannot see themselves reflected in the data systems that influence policy and care delivery.

To address this, the consortium’s approach is grounded in **OCAP® principles** (Ownership, Control, Access, and Possession). Rather than retrofitting OCAP onto existing systems, the intent is to embed these principles upstream through governance structures, data-sharing agreements, and technical design. The consortium effectively acts as the trustee for Indigenous data, ensuring that data stewardship aligns with community values, consent expectations, and sovereignty.

There is an opportunity to learn from established models such as the **Manitoba Centre for Health Policy (MCHP)**, particularly with respect to long-standing data-sharing agreements, governance frameworks, and mechanisms that balance population-level analytics with community oversight. While the contexts differ, MCHP offers practical lessons in how trust, legal agreements, and technical infrastructure can co-evolve.

Overall, progress in this area depends on the coordinated development of **technology platforms, governance policies, and formal agreements**. None of these elements is sufficient on its own; sustainable Indigenous data governance requires alignment across all three.

## **Wearables and Mobile Health in Northern and Remote Contexts**

There has been strong interest in wearables and mobile health solutions as potential tools to support care delivery and research in remote and northern communities. However, the practical reality is that **the enabling infrastructure has often been lacking**.

Attempts to use platforms such as **REDCap** were unsuccessful in some settings, not due to lack of interest, but because of connectivity constraints, usability challenges, and hardware limitations. In some cases, the available devices were **older iPads** that were not well suited to sustained field use or modern mobile health applications.

As a result, frontline teams frequently reverted to **paper-based workflows**, even when digital tools were nominally available. This was not resistance to technology per se, but a pragmatic response to tools that did not fit the operational context. Reliability, simplicity, and trust in the workflow mattered more than novelty.

These experiences highlight that mobile health and wearable strategies must be designed with **infrastructure realism** in mind. Without reliable connectivity, appropriate hardware, local support, and workflows that reduce—not increase—burden, adoption will remain limited regardless of the potential value of the data being collected.

## **Vaccines and the Hemophilus influenza type A Trial in Nunavut**

The Hemophilus influenza type A vaccine trial in Nunavut provides an important example of conducting complex clinical research in northern and Indigenous contexts. It underscores both the feasibility of high-quality trials in these settings and the additional layers of coordination required—particularly around logistics, governance, and community engagement.

Key lessons include the importance of trusted local partnerships, culturally appropriate engagement, and flexible operational models that can adapt to weather, travel constraints, and community priorities. These experiences are directly relevant to future vaccine and public health research initiatives in the North.

## **Federal Investments in Northern Communications Infrastructure**

The Government of Canada is making new and significant investments in **communications infrastructure in the North**, with a focus on improving reliability, bandwidth, and security. These investments are not solely health-driven; they are also framed in terms of **national security and defence of the North**.

From a health and research perspective, these upgrades have important downstream implications. Improved communications infrastructure can help close longstanding gaps in telehealth, emergency response coordination, data transfer, and remote monitoring. At the same time, the emphasis on security highlights existing vulnerabilities and the need for health systems to align with evolving federal standards for cyber-security and data protection.

These infrastructure improvements create a window of opportunity to better integrate health, research, and emergency response systems—provided that health sector requirements are explicitly considered in planning and implementation.
