**Below is a ****practical, submission-ready outline** of the  **core documents required for a final Canada Foundation for Innovation Innovation Fund (IF) submission** **, with emphasis on ** **required structure, content expectations, and review logic** **. This is written to be directly usable for institutional coordination and PI guidance.**

I will reference [**Canada Foundation for Innovation**](chatgpt://generic-entity?number=0) once for clarity.

# **CFI Innovation Fund**

## **Final Submission – Core Documents and Required Structure**

The Innovation Fund final submission is **highly structured**. Reviewers read it **criterion-by-criterion**, not as a narrative grant. Internal alignment and discipline in structure are essential.

---

## **1. Project Module (Online Form – Core Narrative)**

This is the **primary adjudicated content**. All expert committee and multidisciplinary committee assessments are anchored here.

### **1.1 Project Overview (Concise, Strategic Framing)**

**Purpose:** Establish global ambition and institutional relevance.

**Required content**

* Brief description of the research or technology development program
* Clear statement of why the infrastructure is **transformative**
* Explicit linkage to **institutional strategy** (not just PI science)

**Structural guidance**

* 1–2 tightly written paragraphs
* Avoid technical depth; this is positioning

---

### **1.2 Research or Technology Development Program**

**Criterion: Quality of Research or Technology Development**

**This is the ** **most heavily weighted intellectual section** **.**

**Required subsections**

1. **Research Vision and Objectives**
   * International competitiveness
   * Clear, ambitious, and credible goals
2. **Scientific or Technical Context**
   * Why this infrastructure is necessary now
   * What cannot be done without it
3. **Approach and Methodology**
   * High-level methods enabled by infrastructure
   * Avoid experimental minutiae
4. **Research Team**
   * Key contributors
   * Complementary expertise
   * Leadership and governance (brief)

**Structural guidance**

* Explicitly state how **each major infrastructure component** enables the research
* Avoid “shopping list” descriptions
* Use short subheadings; reviewers skim aggressively

---

### **1.3 Description of Infrastructure**

**Criterion: Quality + Capacity**

**Required content**

* Major equipment, platforms, systems, or facilities
* Why each component is essential
* How components integrate into a coherent ecosystem

**Structural guidance**

* Organize by **functional capability**, not vendor or cost category
* Include lifecycle perspective (useful life, upgrade paths)
* Avoid operational detail better suited to O&M

---

### **1.4 Capacity for Innovation**

**Criterion: Capacity for Innovation**

**This section is often ** **under-developed and is a common failure point** **.**

**Required subsections**

1. **Training of Highly Qualified Personnel (HQP)**
   * Students, postdocs, technicians, professionals
   * Skills uniquely enabled by the infrastructure
2. **Collaboration and Access**
   * Internal and external users
   * Cross-disciplinary integration
   * Access model (governance, prioritization)
3. **Management and Governance**
   * Oversight structures
   * Decision-making and accountability

**Structural guidance**

* **Treat this as ** **research infrastructure strategy** **, not HR**
* Demonstrate institutional—not PI-only—ownership

---

### **1.5 Benefits to Canada**

**Criterion: Benefits to Canada**

**This must be ** **specific, plausible, and evidence-linked** **.**

**Required content**

* **Anticipated ****health, social, environmental, or economic benefits**
* Pathways to impact (not promises)
* Relevance to Canadian priorities
* Contribution to Canada’s global leadership

**Structural guidance**

* Organize benefits by category
* Include short-term and long-term impacts
* Avoid vague “will enable innovation” statements

---

### **1.6 Equity, Diversity, and Inclusion (EDI)**

**Cross-cutting assessment consideration**

**Required content**

* How EDI is embedded in:
  * Team composition
  * Access to infrastructure
  * Training environments
* Removal of systemic barriers

**Structural guidance**

* Integrate EDI into **capacity and governance**, not as an add-on
* Avoid generic statements; reviewers are trained to detect this

---

## **2. Financial Modules (Highly Structured, Strict Compliance)**

### **2.1 Infrastructure Cost Breakdown**

**Required**

* Eligible costs only
* Vendor-neutral descriptions
* Clear justification

**Common failure**

* Costs that are weakly linked to research objectives

---

### **2.2 Operation and Maintenance (O&M) Plan**

**Criterion: Capacity for Innovation**

**Required content**

* Annual operating costs
* Funding sources (confirmed vs anticipated)
* Sustainability over useful life

**Structural guidance**

* Conservative, credible assumptions
* Clear institutional commitments strengthen scores

---

### **2.3 Partner Contributions**

**Required**

* Cash and in-kind contributions
* Source, status, and restrictions

**Structural guidance**

* Alignment with institutional strategy matters more than raw dollars

---

## **3. Attachments and Supporting Documents**

### **3.1 Institutional Commitment Letter (Mandatory)**

**Purpose**

* Confirms alignment, sustainability, and priority

**Effective letters**

* Explicitly state why this project is **institutionally strategic**
* Reference long-term support and integration

---

### **3.2 CVs (CFI Format)**

**Required**

* Team members only
* Focus on relevance, not completeness

---

### **3.3 Optional Diagrams (Strongly Recommended)**

**While not mandatory, ** **high-quality diagrams materially improve comprehension** **:**

* Infrastructure ecosystem
* Governance and access model
* Integration with existing assets

---

## **4. Internal Alignment Checklist (Strongly Recommended)**

Before submission, ensure:

* Each infrastructure item maps to:
  * Research objective
  * Capacity outcome
  * Benefit to Canada
* O&M aligns with governance narrative
* EDI is visible across multiple sections
* Institutional letter echoes proposal language

---

## **5. How Reviewers Actually Read This**

Expert Committees:

* **Read ****criterion by criterion**
* Penalize weak integration

Multidisciplinary Committees:

* Focus on:
  * Strategic coherence
  * Institutional strength
  * National relevance

**Narrative elegance matters less than alignment and credibility.**

---

## **Optional Next Steps**

If helpful, I can:

1. Produce a **CFI IF master outline template** (Word or Google Docs)
2. **Create a ****reviewer-aligned internal scoring rubric**
3. **Map this structure to a ****college or university-level triage process**
4. **Tailor the outline specifically for ****platform-scale or hub-based proposals**

Indicate your preference and institutional context, and I will proceed accordingly.
