Here are the key evaluation criteria used by the Canada Foundation for Innovation (CFI) Innovation Fund (IF)—based on the official Call for Proposals, Expert Committee Guidelines, and general CFI program criteria. These apply to the 2025/2027 Innovation Fund competitions and reflect how proposals are assessed by review committees.  ￼

Core Evaluation Framework for the CFI Innovation Fund

Fundamental Objectives

All Innovation Fund proposals are assessed against three overarching competition objectives that structure the evaluation:  ￼
	1.	Enable internationally competitive research or technology development
Infrastructure must support research that is competitive at a global level and encourages equitable participation of expert team members.  ￼
	2.	Enhance institutional capacity
The proposed infrastructure should strengthen the institution’s capacity to conduct research or technology development over the useful life of the asset.  ￼
	3.	Generate benefits for Canada
Infrastructure should lead to measurable benefits—social, health, environmental, economic, or otherwise—for Canadians.  ￼

Assessment Criteria (Innovation Fund 2025 and similar calls)

1. Quality of Research or Technology Development

Reviewers assess how compelling and globally competitive the proposed research or technology development program is, and whether the requested infrastructure is essential to achieve it. This includes:  ￼
	•	Scientific/technical excellence of the research program enabled by the infrastructure.
	•	Relevance and necessity of the infrastructure for achieving the research goals.
	•	Strength and track record of the research team.
	•	Quality of the research methods and plans.  ￼

⸻

2. Capacity for Innovation

This criterion evaluates how the project will strengthen research and innovation capacity, including:  ￼
	•	Plans for training highly qualified personnel (students, postdoctoral fellows, technicians).
	•	Evidence of collaboration and how infrastructure will be shared across disciplines and user groups.
	•	Sound operation and maintenance plans ensuring sustainable use of the infrastructure over its lifetime.  ￼

⸻

3. Potential Benefits to Canada

The proposal should clearly demonstrate how its outcomes will benefit Canadians. Review points include:  ￼
	•	Health, social, environmental, economic impacts.
	•	Contribution to Canada’s research leadership and societal needs.
	•	Broader public value, including knowledge translation and community engagement.  ￼

Additional Considerations in Innovation Fund Evaluation

While not always listed as formal criteria with scoring weights, these factors are important in review committees’ assessments:  ￼

Equity, Diversity and Inclusion (EDI)

Modern Innovation Fund assessments place emphasis on how teams and research environments integrate EDI considerations meaningfully (e.g., addressing systemic barriers, inclusive team composition).  ￼

Project Maturity and Feasibility

Infrastructure projects must be appropriately mature with a credible plan for execution, costing, and completion within the competition timelines.  ￼

Integration and Cohesion

Reviewers look for well-integrated proposals where research objectives, infrastructure needs, team expertise, and proposed outcomes are tightly aligned and logically connected.  ￼

⸻

Merit Review Process (Context for Criteria Application)

CFI uses a multi-stage merit-review process where proposals are evaluated first by Expert Committees against detailed assessment criteria, then by Multidisciplinary Assessment Committees considering alignment with the competition objectives, with final recommendations made to the CFI Board.  ￼
