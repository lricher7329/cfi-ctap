# Vaccine Challenge Trial Unit: Comprehensive Technical Specification

**Project:** Clinical Trials Acceleration Platform (CTAP) - CFI Innovation Fund 2027
**Document Version:** 1.0
**Date:** January 2026

---

## Executive Summary

The **Vaccine Challenge Trial Unit** establishes Western Canada's first academic human challenge trial (Controlled Human Infection Model - CHIM) capability at the University of Alberta. This specialized facility enables accelerated vaccine efficacy evaluation through deliberate, controlled exposure of healthy volunteers to pathogens, dramatically reducing the time and participant numbers required for efficacy signals.

**Total Budget: $590,000 CAD** (within Suite 1: Clinical Trials Participant & Procedure Infrastructure)

**Scientific Leadership:** Dr. Michael Houghton, Nobel laureate 2020 (Physiology or Medicine), Director of the Li Ka Shing Applied Virology Institute

## 1. Strategic Context

### 1.1 Why Human Challenge Trials?

Human challenge trials (CHIMs) deliberately expose healthy volunteers to pathogens under controlled conditions. Key advantages:

| Advantage | Traditional Field Trial | Challenge Trial |
|-----------|------------------------|-----------------|
| **Time to efficacy signal** | 2-5 years | 2-6 months |
| **Sample size** | 10,000-50,000 | 20-100 |
| **Infection timing** | Unknown/random | Precise/controlled |
| **Mechanistic insights** | Limited | Comprehensive |
| **Cost** | $50-500M | $5-15M |

### 1.2 Canada's Current Landscape

Canada currently has **two dedicated CHIM facilities**, both in Eastern Canada:

#### Existing Canadian Facilities

| Facility | Location | Capacity | Status |
|----------|----------|----------|--------|
| **[CCfV Challenge Unit](https://www.challengeunit.ca/)** | IWK Health Centre, Halifax | 10 beds, 5,400-7,000 sq ft | Operational (2022); first Canadian whooping cough CHIM |
| **[Toronto Facility - TBD]** | Toronto area | TBD | Second of two Canadian units |

**CCfV Challenge Unit (Halifax):**
- Funded by CFI and Sanofi Pasteur donation
- 10 single-bed isolation rooms with negative pressure and HEPA-filtered exhaust
- En-suite bathrooms, TV, WiFi, desk in each room
- First inpatient CHIM study in Canada: *Bordetella pertussis* (whooping cough) in 2022
- Partnership with US CDC and NIH
- Associated with upcoming GMP BioLabs East (2027) for local challenge strain manufacturing

#### International Exemplars

| Facility | Location | Capacity | Key Features |
|----------|----------|----------|--------------|
| [hVIVO](https://hvivo.com/) | UK/Germany | 150+ beds | World's largest commercial operator |
| Imperial College London | UK | Variable | COVID-19 challenge study pioneer |
| Royal Free Hospital | UK | Specialist unit | Secure containment |
| University of Maryland | USA | Variable | Cholera, norovirus |
| Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine | UK | Variable | Malaria, typhoid |

#### Western Canada Gap

**Alberta and Western Canada have NO CHIM capability.** CTAP's Challenge Trial Unit would be:
- The **first in Western Canada**
- The **third in Canada** (complementing Halifax and Toronto)
- Uniquely co-located with Li Ka Shing Applied Virology Institute
- Integrated with PRAIRIE Hub vaccine manufacturing pipeline

### 1.3 PRAIRIE Hub Integration

The Challenge Trial Unit completes Alberta's integrated vaccine development pipeline by providing clinical validation for two major PRAIRIE Hub programs ($92.3M combined):

**Sub-Program 1: Self-Amplifying RNA Vaccine Platform ($35.3M)**
- **Lead:** Dr. Michael Houghton
- **Technology:** saRNA vaccines (10× lower dose than mRNA, higher manufacturing yield)
- **Target pathogens:** H5N1 influenza, orthopoxviruses, arenaviruses, Hepatitis C

**Sub-Program 2: Comparative Vaccine Platform ($57M)**
- **Leads:** Drs. Maya Shmulevitz & Peter Pelka
- **Goal:** Head-to-head platform comparison (live attenuated, viral vectors, inactivated, recombinant protein)
- **Value:** De-risks platform selection before Challenge Unit validation
