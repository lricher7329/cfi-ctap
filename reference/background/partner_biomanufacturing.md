# **Biomanufacturing in Alberta: Infrastructure, Initiatives, and Key Players**

## **Introduction**

Alberta’s biomanufacturing landscape has expanded rapidly over the past decade, driven by collaborative academic and commercial initiatives. The province now hosts an array of facilities and programs dedicated to producing vaccines, cell therapies, and pharmaceuticals. According to industry data, Alberta’s broader life sciences sector includes roughly 1,000 companies and 34,000 jobs, contributing about **$4.8 billion** to provincial GDP  . Major public investments – from provincial grants to federal strategic funds – are bolstering infrastructure capacity and partnerships. These investments have seeded new manufacturing hubs in Alberta and empowered existing institutions to scale up. This report provides an overview of Alberta’s biomanufacturing ecosystem, highlighting academic centers and companies, recent funding, and the strategic role of **Applied Pharmaceutical Innovation (API)** in catalyzing growth.

## **Applied Pharmaceutical Innovation (API) – A Central Ecosystem Catalyst**

**Applied Pharmaceutical Innovation (API)** is a not-for-profit institute headquartered in Edmonton (with a satellite in Calgary) that plays a pivotal role in Alberta’s life sciences commercialization ecosystem  . Founded to bridge gaps between academic research and industry, API has grown into one of Canada’s largest life-science commercialization organizations . It provides technical expertise, contract R&D and manufacturing services, and training programs that help innovators advance drug, diagnostic, and health technology products to market  . With a network of over 100 scientists, clinicians, and regulatory experts, API has supported more than 75 commercial projects and helped create an estimated **$700 million** in value in the sector . Crucially, API’s activities focus on overcoming barriers that often force Canadian innovations to be developed abroad – keeping talent, intellectual property and investment within Alberta and Canada  .

**Facilities and Infrastructure:** API operates several specialized facilities that provide much-needed biomanufacturing and R&D capacity in Alberta. In the Edmonton Research Park, API manages the **Biotechnology Business Development Centre (BBDC)** – a 72,000 sq. ft. multi-tenant accelerator building with **wet labs, offices, and meeting space** for life science scale-ups  . The BBDC offers flexible lab leasing (complete with shared utilities like fume hoods, gas, vacuum, etc.) and offices so that growing biotech companies can co-locate their R&D and operations . By providing affordable, well-equipped wet labs and shared equipment, the BBDC fills a critical infrastructure gap for companies transitioning from startup to commercial scale  . In addition, API runs the **Drug Development and Innovation Centre (DDIC)**, a Health Canada-licensed facility for Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) production and formulation development. The DDIC features ISO 6 and 7 cleanrooms for **pilot-scale manufacturing and packaging**, a quality control lab for pharmaceutical analytics, and a prototype formulation lab  . Licensed since 2009, the DDIC supports GMP-compliant production of clinical trial materials – including oral solids, liquids, topicals, and even controlled substances – and provides hands-on training in a regulated production environment  . Complementing these, API’s **Pharmaceutical Analysis Laboratory (PAL)** houses advanced analytical instruments (e.g. a 600 MHz NMR spectrometer and multiple LC–MS systems) to characterize small molecules and biologics  . PAL’s capabilities in NMR, mass spectrometry, HPLC, and specialty analyses support everything from molecular structure confirmation to stability testing, with the lab holding licenses to handle restricted substances  . Finally, in Calgary, API maintains a **satellite lab at the Life Sciences Innovation Hub (LSIH)** on the University of Calgary campus, partnering with Innovate Calgary to assist local startups  . Through this Calgary presence, API offers its full suite of R&D and commercialization services to Southern Alberta companies, integrating them into the province’s wider network.

**Strategic Initiatives:** API spearheads several high-impact initiatives aimed at strengthening Alberta’s biomanufacturing capacity and life sciences ecosystem. Foremost among these is the **Canadian Critical Drug Initiative (CCDI)** – an almost **$200 million** project led by API in partnership with the University of Alberta . Announced in 2021–2023, the CCDI is establishing a new integrated research and manufacturing cluster (the “Life Sciences Campus”) in Edmonton’s south research park. At its core will be the **Critical Medicines Production Centre (CMPC)**, a state-of-the-art **83,000 sq. ft.** GMP facility – slated to be the largest of its kind in Canada . The CMPC is designed for **sterile fill–finish manufacturing** of essential medicines, including both traditional small-molecule drugs and certain non-contaminating biologics, at scales sufficient to address national shortages  . Once operational (targeted for 2025–26), the CMPC will be able to produce **tens of millions of doses per year** for routine supply and can be rapidly scaled to supply the entire country with critical drugs in an emergency, with a surge capacity of **70 million doses/year and a 100-day nationwide sprint capability** for pandemic response  . The CCDI also involves upgrading API’s existing BBDC incubator building with **120,000 sq. ft.** of additional space including new GMP suites, expanded warehousing, and an **active pharmaceutical ingredient (API)** production wing, leveraging Alberta’s petrochemical strengths for chemical intermediate supply  . By securing domestic production of key hospital medicines and creating over **350 high-skilled jobs**, CCDI aims to fortify Canada’s health supply chain and anchor new biotech ventures in Alberta  . The initiative has attracted substantial public funding – notably an **$80.5 million** contribution from the Government of Canada’s strategic innovation fund in 2023  , following an early **$5.6 million** Alberta government grant to API (and a related $20 million to UAlberta’s Li Ka Shing Applied Virology Institute) in 2020 . These investments “put API at the heart of [the] national drug strategy” by enabling domestic development of both critical shortage drugs and new therapeutics (especially antiviral drugs emerging from Nobel laureate Michael Houghton’s virology institute)  . In addition to CCDI, API organizes ecosystem-building events such as **Life Sciences Week** and the **Startup TNT Life Sciences Investment Summit** to connect innovators with investors and showcase Alberta’s biotech sector  . API also runs talent and startup programs – for example, a **Life Sciences Fellowship and internship program with Mitacs** to train highly qualified personnel, and a **venture coaching program** to help new founders navigate regulatory and market hurdles  . Through these strategic initiatives, API is not only expanding physical manufacturing capacity but also cultivating the skilled workforce and partnerships needed for a vibrant biomanufacturing ecosystem.

**Role in Alberta’s Biomanufacturing Ecosystem:** API’s multifaceted activities – contract development services, facility operations, training, and partnership facilitation – have made it a linchpin of Alberta’s biomanufacturing ecosystem. By providing SMEs and researchers with access to GMP infrastructure, regulatory expertise, and commercialization support, API helps local innovations advance **“from early discovery through development”** without leaving the province . Its partnerships bridge industry and academia; for instance, API works closely with Alberta’s research universities (University of Alberta, University of Calgary) and health system (Alberta Health Services) to identify needs (such as drug shortages) that local manufacturing can address  . Meanwhile, API collaborates with industry players and investors nationally – exemplified by its leadership of CCDI and involvement in Canada’s broader life sciences strategy. The organization’s not-for-profit model and mandate to reinvest in the sector have helped attract funding and projects to Alberta that might otherwise go elsewhere. In summary, API serves as a **catalyst and integrator**: it is building the physical capacity (labs, production suites) and the intangible infrastructure (skilled talent, networks, and strategic initiatives) required for a thriving biomanufacturing sector in Alberta.

## **Alberta Cell Therapy Manufacturing (ACTM) – Advanced Clinical-Grade Cell Production**

Another cornerstone of Alberta’s biomanufacturing landscape is the **Alberta Cell Therapy Manufacturing (ACTM)** facility at the University of Alberta. ACTM is a specialized **10,000 sq. ft.** GMP production facility focused on cell-based therapies, and it is **one of the most advanced biomanufacturing units in Canada** for regenerative medicine and cell therapy products  . Established in 2014 with a $26.2 million infrastructure investment (from the Canada Foundation for Innovation, Alberta Economic Development, and UAlberta)  , ACTM was purpose-built to meet stringent regulatory standards for producing cells and gene therapy materials for human clinical trials. The facility contains **six ISO-classified clean rooms (Grade B)** equipped with Grade A biosafety cabinets for aseptic processing , plus a dedicated quality control laboratory and a fill–finish suite (the fill–finish area was being completed and validated as of 2021)  . ACTM’s cleanrooms are flexible and can accommodate a wide range of cell manufacturing projects – whether using **adherent or suspension cell cultures, autologous patient-derived cells or allogeneic donor cells, and even cell banking operations** for master cell banks  . The facility is outfitted with specialized equipment for cell expansion and processing at various scales, from traditional culture flasks and bioreactors to fully automated closed systems like the CliniMACS Prodigy for cell isolation and gene editing . This enables ACTM to produce diverse cell therapy products under GMP, including immune cells (e.g. CAR-T cells), stem cells, and other experimental cell types for early-phase clinical trials.

ACTM serves as a **contract development and manufacturing organization (CDMO)** for academic investigators and biotech companies developing cell therapies, vaccines, or gene therapies in Western Canada  . Its experienced staff support clients with process development, analytical assay development, technology transfer, and full GMP manufacturing of clinical trial batches. For example, ACTM has produced: a **potentially curative gene therapy** for lipoprotein lipase deficiency (a rare genetic disorder), **mesenchymal stem cell therapies** for treating septic shock, and plasmid DNA vaccines such as Entos Pharmaceuticals’ COVID-19 vaccine candidate (Covigenix) that recently advanced to Phase II trials  . In fact, when Edmonton-based Entos needed to manufacture its DNA vaccine doses in 2020–21, ACTM’s team worked in tandem with The Ottawa Hospital’s facility to fill vials for Phase I trials – a notable **made-in-Canada vaccine production effort** during the pandemic  . ACTM is also involved in cutting-edge research programs: it supports manufacturing for the renowned **Edmonton Protocol** in Type 1 diabetes (transplanting therapeutic islet cells) and is producing **CAR-T cell immunotherapies** for cancer trials, leveraging expertise of UAlberta scientists like Dr. Greg Korbutt (ACTM’s Scientific Director)  .

ACTM’s capabilities extend beyond production – it also provides fill–finish services (sterile dispensing of final drug product into vials). As of 2021, ACTM could fill approximately **1,000 vials per day**, with plans to automate and scale that to **5,000 vials/day** to meet growing demand . This fill–finish capacity is significant, as there are very few facilities in Canada equipped to aseptically fill cell therapy or vaccine products at clinical scale. The presence of on-site fill–finish means therapies made in Alberta can be fully prepared for patient use without being sent abroad for packaging  .

In recognition of its national importance, ACTM has forged partnerships to create a broader Canadian biomanufacturing network. In 2021, the University of Alberta (ACTM), The Ottawa Hospital’s Biotherapeutics Manufacturing Centre (BMC), and the BioCanRx national immunotherapy network signed a memorandum of understanding to integrate their capabilities as an “end-to-end” solution for Canada’s biotherapeutics manufacturing needs  . This partnership allows the facilities to share expertise, jointly tackle projects, and coordinate training of highly qualified personnel. As Dr. Stéphanie Michaud (CEO of BioCanRx) noted, the collaboration not only scales up manufacturing capacity but also **establishes hands-on GMP training** opportunities to address the “astounding demand” for skilled biomanufacturing personnel in Canada  . For Alberta, this means ACTM is now linked into a pan-Canadian network, attracting projects that leverage its unique strengths (e.g. cell therapy production) in combination with other sites. With its **state-of-the-art infrastructure and track record**, ACTM has positioned Alberta as a leader in the manufacture of cell and gene therapies for clinical trials – a critical piece in the province’s emerging biomanufacturing ecosystem. Going forward, ACTM will continue enabling “bench-to-bedside” translation of novel therapies by providing the compliant production environment and expertise needed to bring innovative treatments to Alberta patients and beyond  .

## **Other Key Players and Investments in Alberta’s Biomanufacturing Sector**

Beyond API and ACTM, Alberta’s biomanufacturing landscape features a growing cast of companies, institutions, and partnerships that together form a robust innovation cluster. **Major private-sector initiatives** in recent years have focused on building new production capacity for vaccines, genetic medicines, and pharmaceutical ingredients in the province:

* **Entos Pharmaceuticals:** A University of Alberta spin-off biotech, Entos is developing genetic medicines using its proprietary Fusogenix proteolipid vehicle (PLV) delivery platform. In March 2025, Entos announced a **$198.5 million** project to construct a **103,000 sq. ft.** R&D and biomanufacturing facility in Edmonton devoted to genetic therapeutics (including mRNA/DNA vaccines and gene therapies) . The Governments of Canada and Alberta have together committed **$77.5 million** (federal **$62 million** and Alberta **$15.5 million**) toward this facility under a partnership to strengthen domestic vaccine and drug production  . The new Edmonton facility will enable Entos to produce its cutting-edge nucleic acid therapeutics at commercial scale in-province, and serve as a hub for collaborations – Entos has already partnered with global firms like **Eli Lilly** (on neurologic genetic therapies) and others on cancer and rare disease programs  . Entos’s expansion underscores Alberta’s attractiveness for biotech manufacturing, bolstered by public investment and strong university ties. University leadership lauded the investment as ensuring Alberta and UAlberta “continue to play a leading role” in Canada’s pharmaceutical sector . Once operational, Entos’s facility will significantly increase Alberta’s capacity to produce **“finished vials of therapeutics and vaccines,”** aligning with Canada’s post-pandemic Biomanufacturing Strategy goals  .
* **Northern RNA Inc.:** In Calgary, Northern RNA (NRNA) has emerged as a critical player in nucleic-acid drug manufacturing. NRNA is a CDMO specializing in production of mRNA, plasmid DNA, and related raw materials (such as capping analogs and lipids for nanoparticle delivery)  . In late 2023, Northern RNA secured a **$25 million** public funding package (including **$15 million** from the federal Strategic Innovation Fund, **$5 million** from Alberta’s Ministry of Technology and Innovation, and **$5 million** via PrairiesCan) to establish a **GMP-compliant lipid manufacturing facility** in Calgary  . This project, valued at $50 million overall, will allow NRNA to produce critical lipid nanoparticle components domestically – a capability identified as a strategic gap during COVID-19 vaccine rollout  . By 2025, the new facility is expected to create 100 new jobs and secure Canada’s supply of specialized lipids needed for mRNA vaccines and therapeutics  . Northern RNA’s expansion highlights the province’s commitment to building out the **vaccine supply chain** end-to-end: once complete, Alberta will host companies that can make every key ingredient of mRNA medicines (from DNA plasmids and mRNA at NRNA to LNP lipids, and fill–finish at sites like API’s CMPC). Federal ministers noted this investment **“strengthens Alberta’s growing biomanufacturing and life sciences industry”**, positioning Calgary as a cornerstone of Canada’s drug manufacturing capacity  .
* **Gilead Sciences (Edmonton Operations):** Long before the recent biotech boom, Alberta has been home to significant pharmaceutical manufacturing via Gilead Sciences’ Edmonton facility. Gilead Alberta ULC (originally acquired as a small-molecule API manufacturer in 2006) produces active pharmaceutical ingredients for Gilead’s drugs in areas like antivirals (HIV, hepatitis) and oncology. In 2015–2017, Gilead invested **$100 million** to expand its Edmonton campus, adding two new laboratory buildings and a process development tower  . This expansion grew the site to **~184,000 sq. ft.** and increased headcount by about 170 scientists, bringing total local employment to ~350 highly skilled jobs  . The Edmonton site provides process chemistry, scale-up, and production of drug ingredients for clinical trials and commercial supply, serving as a **global manufacturing hub** for Gilead. Its sustained presence demonstrates Alberta’s strengths in chemical manufacturing (leveraging the province’s petrochemical base and talent pool) and has been held up by local leaders as a “recession-proof” diversification of the economy . Gilead’s ongoing operations – and periodic reinvestments – anchor the province’s pharmaceutical manufacturing capacity in small molecules, complementing the newer biologics and cell therapy initiatives.
* **Emerging Academic Facilities:** Alberta’s research institutions continue to invest in biomanufacturing capabilities that complement the above. In Calgary, the **Arnie Charbonneau Cancer Institute** has launched a Biomanufacturing Program as part of the new **Riddell Centre for Cancer Immunotherapy**. This program features a **process development lab, quality control lab, and a GMP cell manufacturing lab** that will produce experimental cell therapy products for early-phase trials  . Housed in the Calgary Cancer Centre, the GMP cell lab is expected to be fully constructed and operational by 2026 . It will focus on manufacturing **research-grade and early clinical-grade cell and gene therapy vectors** (such as viral vectors for CAR-T cells) and training personnel in a QA/QC-regulated environment  . This addition in Calgary – alongside UAlberta’s ACTM in Edmonton – means each of Alberta’s major cities will have dedicated infrastructure for cell therapy manufacturing, greatly expanding capacity for local clinical trials in immunotherapy and regenerative medicine.
* **BioAlberta and Ecosystem Partnerships:** Underpinning all these efforts is a strong network of industry and government support. **BioAlberta**, the province’s life science industry association, works with government and research partners to foster the sector’s growth. The provincial government, through agencies like **Alberta Innovates** and targeted programs (e.g. the Vaccine and Infectious Disease Organization and the Alberta Vaccine Development grant that funded Entos ), has funneled strategic investments into infrastructure and company scale-up. Federally, Alberta-based projects have been big beneficiaries of Canada’s **$2.2 billion Biomanufacturing and Life Sciences Strategy (2021–2028)**  , which provided the large grants to API/CCDI, Entos, Northern RNA, and others. These public investments often come with requirements for collaboration – for example, API’s federal funding involves partnering with UAlberta’s Li Ka Shing Applied Virology Institute , and Entos’s funding builds on its alliance with a major pharma company (Eli Lilly) . Such partnerships between **academia, government, and industry** are a defining feature of Alberta’s biomanufacturing landscape. They ensure that new facilities not only have modern equipment, but also pipelines of innovative projects and trained personnel to sustain operations. Importantly, many of Alberta’s biomanufacturing initiatives have a national and international outlook – whether through formal MOUs (e.g. ACTM with Ottawa’s BMC ) or by attracting global partners (e.g. Northern RNA teaming up with vaccine developers, and API’s CMPC offering capacity to pharmaceutical firms worldwide). This collaborative, multi-sector approach has been key to Alberta’s success in securing life-science investments despite a competitive global market.

In summary, the past 5–10 years have seen **transformative growth in Alberta’s biomanufacturing sector**, marked by new infrastructure and robust partnerships. The province now boasts capabilities ranging from small-molecule drug synthesis to cutting-edge cell therapy production. With Applied Pharmaceutical Innovation providing coordination and talent development, and facilities like ACTM, the new API-CMPI plant, Entos’s genetic medicine center, and Northern RNA’s lipid factory coming online, Alberta is rapidly becoming a Canadian powerhouse in biomanufacturing. Ongoing public and private investments – exceeding several hundred million dollars in total – continue to expand capacity and enable local companies and researchers to bring life-saving innovations from bench to bedside. This integrated network of academic and commercial assets positions Alberta to not only respond to future health crises with domestic solutions, but also to compete globally in the development and production of next-generation therapies.
