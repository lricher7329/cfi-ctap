# Research Data Storage Service

Enabling researchers with on site storage solutions.

The research data storage service (RDSS) provides a powerful on-site data storage solution for those conducting research at the University of Alberta.

## How to request the service

In order to take advantage of the Research Data Storage Service, eligible users will need to submit an IT Service Request through the [University of Alberta service portal](https://universityofalberta.freshservice.com/support/catalog/items/232).

All questions asked on the IT Service Request about data types were formulated in collaboration with the VPR, CISO and the Library's Research Data Management group. These questions are asked for security purposes and to ensure that the proper logging procedures are in place.

Instructions are available in the [Requesting the Research Data Storage Service](https://www.ualberta.ca/en/information-services-and-technology/media-library/initiatives/requesting-the-research-data-storage-service.pdf) document.
