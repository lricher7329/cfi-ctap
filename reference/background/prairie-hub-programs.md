**Below is a ** **focused extension of the Alberta biomanufacturing ecosystem overview** **, drilling down on the ** **PRAIRIE Hub sub-components funded through the Canadian Biomanufacturing and Research Fund (CBRF/BRIF)** **, with particular attention to the ****self-amplifying RNA (saRNA) program led by Michael Houghton** and the **vaccine platform program co-led by Maya Shmulevitz** at the University of Alberta. This is framed to complement API, ACTM, and provincial investments you are already considering.

## **PRAIRIE Hub for Pandemic Preparedness: Strategic Context**

The [**PRAIRIE Hub for Pandemic Preparedness**](chatgpt://generic-entity?number=0) is a western-Canada–wide consortium led by the [**University of Alberta**](chatgpt://generic-entity?number=1), with partners at the Universities of Calgary, Saskatchewan, and Manitoba, plus multiple industry collaborators. It is one of **five national hubs** funded under the **Canadian Biomanufacturing and Research Fund (CBRF)** and **Biosciences Research Infrastructure Fund (BRIF)** to close Canada’s long-standing gap between **vaccine discovery, clinical readiness, and domestic manufacturing**.

Key features relevant to ecosystem planning:

* **~$100M awarded to U of A–led teams** within PRAIRIE Hub
* **~$70M dedicated to biomanufacturing infrastructure and equipment** **, not just research**
* Explicit **bench-to-biomanufacturing mandate**, tightly aligned with API and ACTM capacity
* Designed to be **standing infrastructure** for future pandemics, not one-off COVID-style projects**  **

Within PRAIRIE Hub, two sub-programs are particularly relevant to Alberta’s **vaccine and RNA manufacturing strategy**.

## **Sub-Program 1: saRNA Vaccine Platform (Michael Houghton)**

### **Scientific and Strategic Lead**

* [**Michael Houghton**](chatgpt://generic-entity?number=2)
* **Director, **[**Li Ka Shing Applied Virology Institute**](chatgpt://generic-entity?number=3)
* Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine (2020)

### **Funding and Scope**

* **$35.3M over four years**
* **Targets ** **three high-risk viral families** **:**
  * Influenza (including H5N1)
  * Orthopoxviruses (e.g., mpox, smallpox)
  * Arenaviruses (e.g., Lassa fever)

### **Core Technology: Self-Amplifying RNA (saRNA)**

This program is centred on **self-amplifying RNA (saRNA)**, an evolution of mRNA technology with major manufacturing and deployment advantages:

| **Feature**   | **saRNA Advantage**           |
| ------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| Dose                | ~10× lower than conventional mRNA  |
| Manufacturing yield | Dramatically higher doses per batch |
| Cost                | Lower cost per dose                 |
| Reactogenicity      | Potentially fewer side effects      |
| Global scalability  | Easier rapid global deployment      |

Houghton’s group is not stopping at discovery; the mandate explicitly includes:

* **Antigen discovery and optimization**
* **Preclinical testing**
* **Manufacturing process development**
* **Clinical-trial–ready material**
* **Rapid scale-up readiness during outbreak detection**

### **Integration with Alberta’s Manufacturing Stack**

This is where ecosystem alignment becomes critical:

* [**Applied Pharmaceutical Innovation**](chatgpt://generic-entity?number=4) is an  **explicit industry partner** **, linking:**
  * saRNA process development → GMP translation
  * Academic IP → domestic manufacturing
* Downstream compatibility with:
  * **API’s ****Critical Medicines Production Centre (CMPC)** (fill-finish, sterile injectables)
  * ACTM (for RNA-based cell or gene-adjacent workflows, where relevant)

**Interpretation:**

This program effectively positions Alberta as **Canada’s saRNA vaccine engine**, with vertically integrated discovery → manufacturing pathways that did not exist pre-COVID.

## **Sub-Program 2: Comparative Vaccine Platform Program (Maya Shmulevitz)**

### **Leadership**

* **Co-led by **[**Maya Shmulevitz**](chatgpt://generic-entity?number=5)
* Canada Research Chair in Molecular Virology and Oncology
* Professor, Medical Microbiology & Immunology, U of A
* In partnership with [**Peter Pelka**](chatgpt://generic-entity?number=6) (University of Manitoba)

### **Funding and Scope**

* **~$57M federal investment**
* Objective: **systematically compare vaccine delivery platforms** across pathogen classes and populations

### **Platforms Under Evaluation**

This program is intentionally platform-agnostic and comparative:

* Live attenuated virus
* Viral vectors (e.g., adenovirus-based)
* Whole inactivated virus
* Recombinant protein vaccines
* Alternative delivery routes (intranasal, inhaled)

### **Strategic Differentiators**

What distinguishes this program from traditional vaccine R&D:

1. **Head-to-head platform comparison** **, not single-technology focus**
2. Advanced immune profiling:
   * Mucosal vs systemic immunity
   * Durability of response
   * Performance in immunocompromised populations
3. **Explicit ** **manufacturability lens** **:**
   * Which platforms scale fastest?
   * Which are most robust to supply-chain disruption?

### **Relevance to Alberta Infrastructure**

* Outputs directly inform:
  * **Which platforms should be domestically manufactured**
  * **What fill-finish and formulation capabilities are required**
* Strong alignment with:
  * **API’s role as ****platform-agnostic GMP enabler**
  * ACTM’s sterile injectable and cell-adjacent manufacturing expertise

**Interpretation:**

This program functions as a **national decision-support engine** for vaccine platform investment — de-risking future capital allocation in facilities like API CMPC.

## **How These PRAIRIE Hub Components Strengthen Alberta’s Biomanufacturing Ecosystem**

### **1. Vertical Integration (Discovery → GMP)**

Together, the Houghton and Shmulevitz programs close the loop between:

* Discovery science
* Platform selection
* Manufacturing process design
* Clinical readiness

This directly complements:

* API (scale-up, GMP, fill-finish, commercialization)
* ACTM (clinical-grade sterile manufacturing)

### **2. Platform Diversity (Strategic Resilience)**

Rather than betting solely on mRNA:

* **Alberta is investing in ****RNA, viral, protein, and live-attenuated platforms**
* Reduces risk of single-technology failure in future pandemics

### **3. Talent and Workforce Development**

* Embedded training of:
  * GMP-aware scientists
  * Regulatory-literate trainees
  * Bioprocess engineers
* Strengthens Alberta’s long-term biomanufacturing labour pool

### **4. National Positioning**

Combined with API’s CMPC and ACTM:

* **Alberta emerges as ****Canada’s most integrated vaccine R&D + manufacturing node west of Toronto**
* Strong complement to Montreal (NRC, Sanofi) and Ottawa (BMC)

## **Bottom Line for Strategic Planning**

From an ecosystem and investment perspective:

* **API** is the **industrial spine**
* **ACTM** is the **advanced clinical manufacturing anchor**
* **PRAIRIE Hub sub-programs** are the **upstream innovation engines that justify and sustain manufacturing investment**

Together, they form a **coherent, defensible biomanufacturing strategy**, not a collection of isolated projects.

If you wish, next steps could include:

* A **one-page ecosystem map** linking PRAIRIE Hub → API → ACTM → CMPC
* A **positioning brief** for provincial or federal stakeholders
* A **gap analysis** (e.g., lipid nanoparticles, viral vector scale-up, QA/QP workforce)

I can tailor the next deliverable to your immediate use case (briefing note, slide deck, or funding alignment memo).
