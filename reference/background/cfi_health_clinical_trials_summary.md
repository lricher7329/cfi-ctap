## Strategic Observations for CTAP Proposal

### Successful Precedents to Reference
1. **National platforms with multi-institutional collaboration** (CGEn, CLSA, SecureData4Health)
2. **Integrated data + trials infrastructure** (Queen's Cancer Trials Group combines IT, biobanking, regulatory compliance, data science)
3. **AI-enabled health platforms** emerging as priority (DARC NLP, CatalystDx)

### Gap Analysis: Alberta Opportunity
- Alberta has strong clinical trials funding history ($36M) but limited health data infrastructure investment ($1.3M)
- No Alberta project has combined health data infrastructure with clinical trials acceleration
- Connect Care integration is a unique provincial asset not yet leveraged in CFI infrastructure

### Comparable Scale for CTAP ($10M target)
Projects in the $8-12M range typically feature:
- Multi-institutional partnerships (3-5+ collaborators)
- National or provincial platform scope
- Integration of data infrastructure + research capacity
- Clear translational pathway
- Sustained operational model

### Key Differentiators to Emphasize
1. **AI/ML integration** (building on DARC NLP precedent)
2. **Provincial health records integration** (Connect Care—unique to Alberta)
3. **Discovery infrastructure linkage** (Amii connection)
4. **Clinical trials acceleration** (addressing national competitiveness)
