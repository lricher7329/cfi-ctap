## Living with the unpredictable

- MS can cause loss of balance, impaired speech, extreme fatigue, double vision, paralysis, mental health problems and reduced lifespan.
- MS is the most common cause of neurological disability in young adults (ages 15-40). It most often strikes at a time when most people are finishing school, starting careers and raising families.
- Only 20 per cent of MS patients are working 10 years after diagnosis.
- Alberta has one of the highest rates of MS in the world.
- Women are three times more likely to develop MS than men.

The University of Alberta's dedicated MS Centre demonstrates what can be done at an academic centre when science and medicine are linked. We bring together people with different areas of expertise, and MS researchers also work with patients in the MS Clinic. This approach:

- **educates** medical professionals in all aspects of MS
- **expands** opportunities for educators, researchers and students from diverse fields to collaborate MS
- **develops** a new generation of highly qualified MS health care professionals and MS researchers
