**Source Document:** CBRF2-2023-00132 - Accelerating pandemic response and biomanufacturing through integrated biorepositories
**Application ID:** CBRF2-2023-00132
**Administering Organization:** University of Alberta

---

## Executive Summary

The B-PREPARED (Integrated Biobanks for Pandemic PREPAREDness and biomanufacturing in Alberta) project proposed enhancing the biobanking infrastructure at the University of Alberta, building on 20+ years of experience through the Canadian BioSample Repository (CBSR). The proposal aimed to expand freezer capacity by 200%, provide properly ventilated physical space, and enhance electrical and cooling backup systems.

## Proposed Infrastructure Expansion at UAlberta

### Cold Storage Capacity Expansion

**Budget Allocation:** $946,333.47

| Item | Quantity | Description |
|------|----------|-------------|
| -80°C Chest Freezers | 20 | New Brunswick freezers (230 V, 60 Hz, 2-stage compressors) |
| CO₂ Backup Controllers | 20 | One per freezer |
| NUNC Hotels | 66 per freezer | Aluminum cryotube storage (11×6 configuration) |
| CO₂ Tanks | 40 + 28 backup | Emergency cooling (24-72 hour backup) |
| Safety Brackets/Holders | 68 | Wall or floor mounted |
| Weigh Scales | 20 + 4 backup | Monitor CO₂ tank fullness |
| Portable Peroxide Generator | 1 | Regular disinfection |

**Rationale for Chest Freezers:**
- Hold temperature when opened (unlike uprights where cold air escapes due to gravity)
- Reduced temperature fluctuations = less compressor load
- Maximizes freezer longevity
- Most cost-effective, energy-efficient, and reliable
- Generates least heat

### Storage Capacity Calculations

Cryotubes stored in standard SBS (Society for Biomolecular Screening) 8×12 arrays:

| Configuration | Tubes/Pallet | Pallets/Hotel | Hotels/Freezer | Total Tubes/Freezer |
|--------------|--------------|---------------|----------------|---------------------|
| 0.3 mL tubes | 96 | 25 | 66 | 158,400 |
| 0.5 mL tubes | 96 | 19 | 66 | 120,384 |
| 1 mL tubes | 96 | 13 | 66 | 82,368 |
| 2 mL tubes | 48 | 11 | 66 | 34,848 |
| 5 mL tubes | 48 | 6 | 66 | 19,008 |

**Capacity Justification:**
Based on experience with:
- Blood-borne pathogens project: 184,993 aliquots from 1,000 participants (serial collections)
- COVID-19 Surveillance Collaboration (CoCollab): 147,705 aliquots from 715 participants

Projected need: Up to 15× current capacity for Hub-related projects, ongoing surveillance, remnant sample storage, and future infectious diseases with pandemic potential.

**Anticipated Usage:**
- 75-90% of expanded capacity for PRAIRIE Hub investigators, other Canadian Hubs, and biomanufacturing support
