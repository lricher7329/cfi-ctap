**Re: Letter of Support – Clinical Trials Acceleration Platform (CTAP), CFI Innovation Fund 2027**

Dear Dr. Richer,

On behalf of the Alberta Machine Intelligence Institute (Amii), I am pleased to support the Clinical Trials Acceleration Platform (CTAP) application to CFI Innovation Fund 2027.

**The Imperative**

AI has transformed drug discovery, protein structure prediction, and manufacturing—yet clinical trials remain the critical bottleneck. The average trial still takes 7+ years and $40M+ to complete, with 80% of trials failing to meet enrollment timelines. This is not a scientific problem; it is an integration problem. CTAP addresses this directly by embedding AI into trial operations from design through analysis.

**Amii's Commitment**

Amii is one of Canada's three national AI institutes, with global leadership in reinforcement learning and health AI. Several of our CIFAR AI Chairs will contribute directly to CTAP:

- **Dr. Ross Mitchell** (CIFAR AI Chair): Clinical AI deployment expertise; AI Scribe across Alberta EDs; CRAIDL leadership
- **Dr. Mohamed Abdalla** (CIFAR AI Chair): Clinical NLP and privacy-preserving AI
- **Dr. Lazar Atanackovic** (Amii Fellow): Generative AI and causal inference for trial simulation

Amii commits to supporting CTAP through research collaboration on CRAIDL agent development, access to compute resources via the SDRE partnership, talent pipeline through our training programs, and industry connections to accelerate adoption.

**Strategic Fit**

Alberta's convergence of AI expertise, unified provincial health data, and translational infrastructure is unmatched in Canada. CTAP is the integration layer that transforms these assets into accelerated patient benefit. Amii strongly endorses this proposal.

Sincerely,

**Cam Linke, PhD**
Chief Executive Officer
Alberta Machine Intelligence Institute (Amii)
