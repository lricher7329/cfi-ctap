# Sustainability

CTAP is designed as a permanent, institutionally embedded research platform, not a time-limited project. Sustainability is ensured through (1) formal governance embedded within existing university and health-system structures; (2) integration with University of Alberta Clinical Trials (UACT); (3) a conservative, diversified operating and revenue model aligned with a multi-decade history of operational and fiscal experience (UACT members, NACTRC, CTO); and (4) active demand generation through national programs and industry-facing services.

## Governance and Management

CTAP operates within a multi-tier governance framework anchored in the Kipnes Health Research Institute, ensuring accountability, continuity, and alignment with institutional priorities.

Oversight and Strategy

* CTAP Steering Committee, chaired by the UACT lead and co-chaired by Kipnes Institute leadership, with representation from CTO, NACTRC, CVC, WCHRI, CBSR, Indigenous leadership, and patient partners. This committee sets strategic direction, approves major investments, and ensures alignment with provincial and national clinical trials priorities.

Operations and Access

* Operations Committee is responsible for day-to-day coordination across clinical, biorepository, data, and AI cores.
* Data Access Committee, modelled on the UK Biobank Access Committee, governing researcher access, TRE workspace approvals, and data-use conditions.
* CRAIDL Development Committee, with AI/computer science and clinical trials expertise (AI+Health Hub, PHAIR Lab, Amii), ensuring technical sustainability of AI agents and software assets.

Equity, Ethics, and Indigenous Governance

* EDI and Indigenous Advisory Council are embedded across all CTAP activities.
* Indigenous Data Governance Committee, co-chaired by Indigenous Clinical Trials Unit leadership and a First Nations Health Consortium representative, overseeing OCAP implementation, TRE Zone 1 custodianship, data-sharing agreements, and community benefit provisions.

External Review

* Scientific Advisory Board with external representation from ACT-AEC, PRAIRIE Hub, RareKids-CAN, and international partners, providing independent oversight and ensuring CTAP remains aligned with evolving global standards.

This governance model ensures continuity beyond individual leaders, embeds CTAP within durable institutional structures, and de-risks long-term operation.

## Institutional Commitments

Within the University of Alberta Clinical Trials (UACT), CTAP serves as an integral institutional platform, with operational governance provided by the Clinical Trials Office and Kipnes Health Research Institute. Integration of CTAP into institutional strategic plans and research enablement portfolios. Access to and alignment with the Institute's AI + Health Hub and Health Research Translation Unit for administrative, regulatory, and translational support.

### Operations and Maintenance

CFI's Infrastructure Operating Fund (IOF) offsets a substantial portion of operating costs. Based on the total project cost of $8,318,879 and CFI contribution (40%) of $3,327,552, the 5-year IOF allocation is approximately $998,000. This, combined with diversified revenue streams, ensures the net institutional O&M commitment is well within existing research enablement budgets.

### Revenue Model and Financial Sustainability

CTAP employs a conservative, activity-based revenue model tied directly to research throughput, ensuring scalability without over-reliance on any single funding source.

Core Revenue Streams

* Indirect Costs of Research (ICR) from industry-sponsored clinical trials.
* Cost-recovery user fees for biobanking, storage, and integrated omics services (e.g., $35/sample processing; $5–15/sample/year storage) → Projected $200,000–$400,000/year at steady state.
* Industry-facing services, including:
  * Trial feasibility queries ($2,500/query)
  * TRE workspace provisioning ($15,000/study-year)
  * CRAIDL AI agent access ($5,000/study)
  * CDISC transformation and regulatory submission support ($20,000/submission) → Projected $150,000–$300,000/year.
* Grant-supported access fees embedded in budgets from national programs (PRAIRIE Hub, ACT-AEC, CIHR, NFRF).
* Philanthropic support, including ongoing leverage of the Kipnes gift for strategic enhancements.

At steady state, these revenues are expected to fully offset the net institutional O&M commitment, with upside capacity as trial volume increases.

### Accessibility, Utilization, and Demand Sustainability

Sustainability is further ensured through high utilization and continuous demand generation, supported by: (1) Transparent access, prioritization, and pricing policies across all cores; (2) Common SOPs and service menus to minimize friction and ensure predictable cost recovery; (3) HQP training and mentorship programs embedded within platform operations; (4) Availability of CRAIDL AI agents as a unique national attractor for RCTs and rare disease studies; (5) Continuous monitoring of quality, safety, and regulatory performance metrics required of an academic trial sponsor.

By embedding CTAP within national trial networks, regulatory-grade workflows, and AI-enabled services, demand is expected to grow organically and persist beyond the initial funding horizon.

In summary, CTAP's sustainability is secured through institutional embedding, diversified and conservative revenue streams, disciplined O&M planning, and strong governance—ensuring that the infrastructure remains fully operational, accessible, and impactful well beyond the CFI funding period.
