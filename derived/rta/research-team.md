## CTAP Core Team Summaries

**Michael Houghton** — Vaccine Challenge Trials & Pandemic Preparedness Nobel Laureate (2020) and Professor of Virology at the University of Alberta. Dr Houghton leads the Hepatitis C vaccine program. The Vaccine Challenge Trial Unit (Suite 1a)—Western Canada's first academic Controlled Human Infection Model (CHIM) facility. His hepatitis C vaccine program, effective against all global strains, is among the first candidates for CTAP-enabled first-in-human evaluation. The Challenge Trial Unit provides negative-pressure isolation, 24/7 monitoring, and quarantine capabilities essential for accelerated vaccine development and pandemic preparedness through PRAIRIE Hub.

**Peter Senior** — Decentralised Diabetes Trials & Digital Health. Professor and Clinical Islet Transplant Program leader at the Alberta Diabetes Institute. Dr Senior co-leads Connect1D Canada, a pan-Canadian Type 1 diabetes registry with 6,000+ participants demonstrating CTAP's decentralised trial model: CGM data uploaded from home, patient-reported outcomes via mobile app, linked to Connect Care records. His expertise in multi-source data integration (wearables, EHRs, and patient-reported data) directly informs Suite 5's Trial Innovation Tools and establishes the model for precision cardio-renal-metabolic research across CTAP.

**Justin Ezekowitz** — AI-Enabled Trial Operations & CRAIDL Vision Leader. Co-director of the Canadian VIGOUR Centre (50+ cardiovascular pragmatic trials) and conceptual architect of CRAIDL—CTAP's Clinical Research AI for Intelligent Design and Logistics. Dr Ezekowitz's vision of autonomous agentic AI agents supporting protocol development, regulatory documentation, and trial analysis drives Suite 4's AI strategy. His international cardiovascular trials network provides validated templates and operational expertise that directly inform CRAIDL agent training, ensuring immediate relevance to real-world trial workflows.

**Jason Acker** — Cryopreservation Expertise, Institutional Leadership and Clinical Trial Oversight, Associate Vice-President, Research Integrity Support. Dr Acker provides governance and regulatory expertise across CTAP infrastructure suites. His leadership of the Arise and REBx platforms (research ethics management tools) and his expertise in this role ensure that CTAP infrastructure meets research security requirements and regulatory Division 5 and ICH E6(R3) standards. His cryopreservation expertise supports Suite 2's Living Biorepository quality systems.

**Bruce Ritchie** — Biorepository Leadership & Founding Director of the Canadian BioSample Repository (CBSR). Dr Ritchie brings 20+ years of international biobanking expertise to Suite 2's Living Biorepository—transforming biospecimen management from static storage to an intelligent, EMR-linked discovery engine. His expertise in cryopreservation systems, sample processing workflows, and cross-trial reuse governance enables CTAP's automated outcome annotation and consent-aware sample routing capabilities.

**Giovanni Ferrara** — Digital Health Wearables & Device Validation Professor and Director of the Division of Pulmonary Medicine, and Medical Lead of the Digital Health Unit (CTO). Dr Ferrara leads CTAP's Digital Health Device Validation Program, ensuring novel sensors and digital therapeutics produce data streams compatible with CRAIDL's analytical requirements. His expertise in wearable respiratory monitors and digital therapeutic platforms supports Suite 5's decentralised trial infrastructure, enabling continuous real-world data capture beyond scheduled clinic visits.

**Ross Mitchell** — Clinical AI & Voice-First Documentation, Professor, Canada CIFAR AI Chair, and AHS Chair in AI in Health. Dr Mitchell directs the Provincial Health AI Research Lab (PHAIR) and created AI Scribe ("Jenkins")—now deployed across 10 Alberta emergency departments with 6,700+ sessions. His clinical NLP expertise and production-scale AI deployment experience anchor CRAIDL development, enabling voice-first clinical trial documentation, consent audit trails, and the human-in-the-loop AI architecture that maintains regulatory rigour while reducing startup timelines by 40–50%.

**Mohamed Abdalla** — Privacy-Preserving AI & Participant Identification in Trials. CIFAR AI Chair at Amii and the University of Alberta. Dr Abdalla provides clinical NLP and privacy-preserving AI expertise critical to CTAP's Trusted Research Environment. His de-identification algorithms enable secure Connect Care integration, allowing AI processing of clinical data while maintaining patient privacy. He is also leading a new Alberta Innovates funded program to develop an LLM-based approach to participant identification to support enrolment in clinical trials.

**Gavin Oudit** — Long COVID Translational Science & Autonomic Function Professor and Canada Research Chair in Heart Failure. Dr Oudit leads CTAP's Long COVID Translational Science Program and serves as PI of the taurine supplementation trial (NCT06721949)—the exemplar demonstrating CTAP's bench-to-bedside acceleration. His discovery that SARS-CoV-2 depletes taurine, combined with pre-clinical validation, led to a clinical trial that took 18 months to enrol under conventional infrastructure—a timeline CTAP is designed to compress dramatically. He also leads the Regenerative & Cell-Based Therapeutics flagship program.

**Wayne Clark** — Indigenous Health Research & Data Sovereignty, Founding leader of CTAP's Indigenous Clinical Trials Unit (ICTU)—Canada's first. Dr Clark ensures Indigenous data sovereignty through OCAP-compliant governance embedded in CTAP's technical architecture, not merely policy. His expertise in culturally safe clinical trial design, community-based research, and Indigenous community engagement enables CTAP's 10% Indigenous participation target. He leads Indigenous-led protocol design and community advisory board structures, ensuring equitable access and meaningful participation.
