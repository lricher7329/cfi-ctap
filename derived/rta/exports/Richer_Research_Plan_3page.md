# **Innovation, Feasibility, and International Context**

### **Innovation: An Integrated, AI-Native Clinical Trials Platform**

CTAP introduces a fundamentally new approach to clinical trials infrastructure by addressing the systemic fragmentation that has limited the impact of prior AI and digital health investments. While AI tools have demonstrated strong performance in isolated tasks—such as eligibility screening with 90% sensitivity, recruitment optimization up 50%, and outcome prediction—real-world conversion from identification to enrollment remains persistently low. The limiting factor is not AI capability, but the absence of an integrated operational framework that connects protocol development, ethics submission, recruitment, data capture, safety monitoring, and analysis into a single, coordinated system.

CTAP resolves this gap through three tightly coupled architectural innovations.

First, CTAP deploys an agentic **AI coordination layer (CRAIDL)** that replaces isolated tools with a suite of specialized, communicating AI agents supporting protocol development, ethics, regulatory documentation, safety oversight, data management, budgeting, adjudication, and analysis. These agents operate within a shared operational environment, enabling context-aware handoffs across the trial lifecycle. Developed in partnership with leading AI researchers, four agents are already validated at investigator scale, with phased deployment of the full suite. This multi-agent architecture represents a structural departure from single-purpose AI tools and enables sustained reductions in trial startup time while preserving human oversight.

Second, CTAP establishes a **Living Biorepository** that transforms biospecimen management from static storage into an intelligent, continuously updated discovery resource. Real-time EMR linkage enables automated outcome annotation as clinical events occur, while consent-aware routing ensures samples flow only to approved studies. Event-driven retrieval allows biospecimens to be queued for analysis within hours of clinically meaningful events, replacing months of manual chart review and substantially increasing the scientific yield of each collected sample.

Third, CTAP extends an existing **three-zone Trusted Research Environment** to support regulated clinical trials at scale. Identifiable data, protected AI processing, and de-identified research outputs are technically segregated, enabling secure analytics while meeting regulatory requirements. Critically, this architecture enables Indigenous data sovereignty in practice: custodianship of identifiable data can be governed by Indigenous partners, enforcing OCAP principles through technical controls rather than policy alone.

Together, these innovations compress trial timelines across multiple stages—protocol development, recruitment, biospecimen linkage, and data capture—enabling activation targets aligned with Alberta FAST benchmarks rather than the national average.

### **Feasibility: Built on Existing, Operational Infrastructure**

CTAP is grounded in functioning infrastructure rather than aspirational development. Its implementation builds on four established foundations.

First, the University of Alberta already operates a coordinated provincial trials network. The University of Alberta Clinical Trials consortium and its partners coordinates hundreds of active protocols across multiple clinical investigation units, supported by a province-wide clinical trial management system. National partners contribute validated trial templates that directly inform CRAIDL agent training, ensuring immediate operational relevance.

Second, validated GMP manufacturing capacity is already in place. Alberta Cell Therapy Manufacturing operates functional cell production pipelines, with demonstrated end-to-end delivery from patient leukapheresis to therapeutic administration. The Critical Medicines Production Centre and Applied Pharmaceutical Innovation (API) is one of Canada's largest pharmaceutical manufacturing facilities. Parallel vaccine platforms generate candidates suitable for first-in-human validation through CTAP, creating a seamless discovery-to-clinic pathway.

Third, production-scale clinical AI systems are already deployed. AI scribe technology is in routine clinical use across multiple emergency departments, demonstrating that AI can be safely embedded in real-world workflows. CRAIDL agents are already operating at investigator level, and sustained AI expertise is provided through long-standing institutional partnerships with Amii and more than ten CIFAR AI Chairs.

Fourth, CTAP extends prior infrastructure investment rather than duplicating it. The platform builds on an existing Trusted Research Environment and a fully deployed province-wide electronic medical record system (Connect Care), enabling immediate access to standardized clinical data across the health system.

The assembled team brings deep expertise in clinical trials leadership, AI research, vaccine development, cell therapy, and biorepository management. Implementation follows a phased four-to-five-year plan, with measurable impact within the first 18–24 months. By 2031, CTAP will enable 45-day trial activation timelines, reduce planning-to-activation by up to 50%, double recruitment efficiency, and ensure meaningful rural and Indigenous participation.

### **International Context and National Leadership**

Internationally, individual components of CTAP exist, but no platform integrates them into a single operational framework. Large population cohorts like the UK Biobank and FinnGen in Finland provide valuable research resources but are not designed for trial operations. Disease-specific acceleration programs lack generalizability. Translational precincts emphasize co-location rather than data- and AI-driven integration. None combine regulated trial execution, GMP manufacturing, advanced systems biology, large-scale AI, and province-wide EMR access.

CTAP's distinguishing feature is integration. Within one platform, it unites manufacturing-ready therapies, structural and systems biology, high-throughput metabolomics, top-tier AI expertise, an established trials organization, and a unified health system. This integration enables rapid progression from discovery to first-in-human and population-scale trials without reliance on bespoke, site-specific solutions.

Nationally, CTAP establishes Canada's first AI-native clinical trials acceleration platform. It serves as the Western anchor for emerging national trial networks, pandemic preparedness initiatives, and pediatric rare disease programs. CRAIDL agents are designed for national deployment under open-source licensing, democratizing access to advanced trial capabilities for smaller centres, rural hospitals, and Indigenous communities. Flagship programs include applied clinical AI innovation (PHAIR Lab), Long COVID translational studies, vaccine challenge trials with Nobel laureate Michael Houghton, precision cardio-renal-metabolic research, and pediatric rare disease networks through RareKids-CAN.

Equity, diversity, and inclusion are embedded at the architectural level. CTAP sets explicit participation targets for Indigenous (15%) and rural (20%) populations; establishes Canada's first Indigenous Clinical Trials Unit; enables Indigenous data custodianship within the Trusted Research Environment; and deploys decentralized tools designed for northern and remote operational realities. AI agents undergo systematic bias auditing with community oversight, and consent processes are designed for accessibility across literacy levels and languages.

### **Summary**

CTAP represents a step-change in clinical trials infrastructure. By integrating AI-enabled operations, living biospecimens, secure data environments, and translational pipelines into a single platform, it converts discovery abundance into patient impact. Built on existing strengths and designed for national scale, CTAP positions Alberta—and Canada—as a global leader in fast, rigorous, and equitable clinical research.
