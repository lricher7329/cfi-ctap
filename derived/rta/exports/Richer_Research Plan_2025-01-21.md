### **The Opportunity: Accelerating Translation from Discovery to Patient Impact**

The primary bottleneck in transforming scientific breakthroughs into patient benefit is no longer discovery—it is validation. Advances in AI, molecular biology, and biomanufacturing have dramatically expanded pipelines of vaccines, biologics, and cell-based therapies. Yet clinical trials remain manual, fragmented, and slow. Operational delays in protocol development, ethics review, patient identification, data access, and biospecimen coordination now represent the dominant constraint on clinical translation, extending timelines by years and contributing to widespread trial failure.

The University of Alberta is uniquely positioned to address this challenge. It combines province-wide health system integration through Connect Care, spanning 682 sites and 4.4 million Albertans, with internationally recognised AI leadership through Amii and more than ten CIFAR AI Chairs. These assets are complemented by over $400 million in discovery and translational infrastructure, including PRAIRIE Hub, Alberta Cell Therapy Manufacturing, the Li Ka Shing Institute of Virology, SPP-ARC/Cryo-EM, GlycoNet, and TMIC, as well as proven large-scale AI deployment in clinical settings, such as AI scribe implementation across multiple Alberta emergency departments. No other Canadian institution brings together unified health data, advanced biomanufacturing, structural and systems biology, and production-scale AI within a single ecosystem.

The **Clinical Trials Acceleration Platform (CTAP)** is designed to convert this convergence into a coherent, **AI-native clinical trials infrastructure**. CTAP is not a collection of tools but an integrated platform that embeds AI into the foundational operations of trial design, recruitment, execution, and analysis, transforming how rapidly discoveries move from bench to bedside.

### **From Translational Friction to Integrated Acceleration**

Translating a laboratory discovery into patient benefit remains a 10–15 year process dominated by regulatory, operational, and recruitment delays rather than scientific uncertainty. A representative example is the ongoing taurine supplementation trial for Long COVID. Dr. Gavin Oudit's team identified that SARS-CoV-2 infection depletes taurine, a molecule essential for mitochondrial function and cellular energy metabolism. Pre-clinical studies demonstrated that taurine supplementation restores mitochondrial activity and normalizes cellular metabolism. Despite strong biological rationale and a low-risk intervention, it has taken 18 months to enroll the first patient under conventional trial infrastructure.

CTAP fundamentally alters this trajectory. Protocol development that typically takes months is compressed to weeks through AI-enabled drafting, feasibility assessment, and generation of regulatory-ready documentation. Patient identification shifts from manual chart review to real-time cohort discovery across the provincial health system. Biospecimen management moves from static frozen samples to an EMR-linked Living Biorepository that enables longitudinal, outcome-aligned sampling. Data capture becomes fully digital and voice-first, producing structured, analysis-ready data at the point of care. Collectively, these capabilities transform a fragmented process into an integrated pathway from discovery to first-in-human evaluation.

CTAP builds on and extends existing provincial and national initiatives, including Alberta Fast-track to Accelerate Start-up of clinical Trials (Alberta FAST) and the VITAL/GEMINI federated analytics platforms, positioning Alberta as a national leader in rapid, AI-enabled trial activation.

### **The Integrated Infrastructure Model**

CTAP operates through four tightly coupled domains unified by a three-zone Trusted Research Environment (TRE).

First, CRAIDL provides **AI-enabled trial operations**. A suite of specialized AI agents supports protocol development, ethics submissions, regulatory documentation, safety monitoring, data management, and analysis. These agents operate in a human-in-the-loop model, where all outputs are reviewed and approved by experts, reducing startup timelines by an estimated 40–50% while maintaining regulatory rigour.

Second, the **Living Biorepository** transforms biospecimen management from passive storage into an active discovery engine. Real-time EMR linkage enables automated outcome annotation, consent-aware sample routing, and longitudinal integration with clinical events, dramatically increasing the scientific value of each collected sample.

Third, the **Trusted Research Environment** provides the secure backbone for all trial activity. Building on prior institutional investment, the three-zone architecture separates identifiable data, protected AI processing, and de-identified research outputs. CTAP extends this model with a dedicated Trials Zone designed to meet Health Canada Division 5 and ICH E6(R3) requirements. Critically, this architecture enables Indigenous data sovereignty in practice: custodianship and access control can be governed by Indigenous partners through formal agreements, addressing the absence of Indigenous identifiers in existing health systems and supporting OCAP-aligned governance.

Fourth, **translational integration** connects clinical trials directly to the University of Alberta's core facilities and biomanufacturing assets. Trials are no longer isolated from metabolomics, glycomics, proteomics, imaging, or GMP manufacturing. Instead, CTAP provides standardized interfaces that align protocols, data flows, and quality systems across discovery, manufacturing, and clinical execution.

These domains are interdependent. Without a Living Biorepository, biospecimens lose outcome linkage. Without a TRE, data access delays stall research for months. Without CRAIDL, investigators repeatedly rebuild protocols and documentation from scratch. Without translational integration, core facilities remain siloed. Without trial innovation tools, rural and Indigenous communities are excluded from participation. CTAP addresses these failures as a unified system rather than as isolated fixes.

### Infrastructure Designed for Northern and Rural Reality

CTAP is explicitly designed for operational realities beyond urban academic centres. Northern and Indigenous research contexts impose distinct constraints that conventional digital platforms fail to address. Future studies, such as the Haemophilus influenzae type A vaccine trial in Nunavut, demonstrate both the feasibility of clinical research in these settings and the need for infrastructure that tolerates intermittent connectivity, limited hardware, and constrained staffing.

Previous mobile health deployments in similar contexts failed because they assumed continuous connectivity and imposed workflows that increased the burden on frontline teams. CTAP adopts a different design philosophy. The TRE supports store-and-forward data capture during connectivity windows. Telehealth and data collection kits prioritise reliability, durability, and ease of use over feature richness. This is infrastructure built for real-world conditions, enabling equitable participation across rural, remote, and Indigenous communities.

### Projects Enabled

CTAP infrastructure supports three major categories of research: first-in-human and challenge trials, advanced cell and gene therapy trials, and decentralized pragmatic studies. 

**Types of Projects Enabled:** CTAP infrastructure enables three categories of clinical research:

1. **First-in-Human and Challenge Trials:** Vaccine Challenge Trial Unit (Western Canada's first academic CHIM facility) supports Houghton's hepatitis C vaccine program and pandemic preparedness. Negative-pressure isolation capability enables controlled human infection studies for accelerated vaccine evaluation.
2. **Cell and Gene Therapy Trials:** Integration with ACTM enables autologous and allogeneic cell therapy trials. Pediatric Rare Disease Unit at Stollery CIU (one of 2 Canadian pediatric Phase I sites) anchors the national RareKids-CAN network for gene therapy and rare disease trials requiring 15+ year follow-up.
3. **Decentralized and Pragmatic Trials:** Connect1D Canada (6,000+ participants) demonstrates the decentralized model: CGM data uploaded from home, PROs via mobile app, linked to Connect Care records. Trial Innovation Tools (Suite 5) extend participation to northern and Indigenous communities through store-and-forward telehealth and voice-first AI documentation.
