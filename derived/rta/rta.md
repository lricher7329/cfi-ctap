## Strategic Alignment

The Clinical Trials Acceleration Platform (CTAP) directly operationalizes *Forward with Purpose: A Strategic Plan for Research and Innovation 2023-2028*, which calls for the University of Alberta to address grand challenges through interdisciplinary research, data-enabled discovery, and deep partnerships with health systems. CTAP embodies the plan's emphasis on health and life sciences, artificial intelligence, and digital innovation by creating an integrated, AI-enabled clinical trials infrastructure that links discovery to impact—from molecular design and GMP manufacturing to biospecimen-enabled trials and real-world evidence.

### CTAP's Functional Home: The Dianne and Irving Kipnes Health Research Institute

Established in September 2025 through a $25 million philanthropic gift, the Kipnes Institute is an organizational entity—not a building—housed within the College of Health Sciences (in the renamed Dianne and Irving Kipnes Health Research Academy). The Institute's vision is "to create a learning health system where artificial intelligence enhances care, clinical trials validate breakthroughs, and specialised programs demonstrate the full cycle of research from insight to impact—continuously improving outcomes."

CTAP is the infrastructure backbone that realises this vision. The Institute's **AI + Health Hub** (led by Drs. Neesh Pannu and Gillian Lemermeyer) and **Health Research Translation Unit** provide the governance, operational framework, and community within which CTAP operates—positioning Alberta as "the place where research discoveries reach patients in our communities not in decades, but in years or even months."

### Provincial Alignment

CTAP strongly supports the Alberta Technology and Innovation Strategy (ATIS), which aims to make Alberta an internationally recognised technology and innovation hub. By integrating AI, advanced biomanufacturing (PRAIRIE Hub, ACTM, API/CMPC), secure cloud infrastructure (AWS Canada - Calgary region), and clinical trials at scale, CTAP directly advances ATIS goals in talent development, commercialisation, data-driven innovation, and global competitiveness.

## Core Objectives

By 2031, CTAP will:

- **Achieve Alberta FAST 45-day trial startup** (compared to 9–12 month Canadian average)
- **Reduce trial planning to start-up by 40-50%** (stretch: 4 weeks idea-to-activation)
- **Double recruitment efficiency** with 15% Indigenous/20% rural targets
- **Enable first-in-human (FIH) and advanced-therapy trials** (5+ FIH including challenge studies, 3+ cell therapy trials)
- **Integrate biospecimens with 70%+ trials** having pre-planned pipelines
- **Deploy 8 CRAIDL agents** nationally via ACT-AEC
- **Establish pandemic preparedness capacity** through Challenge Trial Unit
- **Serve as Western anchor** for ACT-AEC, PRAIRIE Hub, RareKids-CAN (20+ sites, 100+ OHDSI institutions)
- **Train 150+ HQP** (20% from underrepresented groups)

## Document Workflow

**Google Docs/Sheets are the ground truth** for RTA submission. Markdown files in this folder are mirrors for easy editing and version control.

### Sync Workflow

1. Edit content in Google Docs/Sheets (ground truth)
2. Pull changes to markdown mirrors using MCP tools
3. For major updates, update markdown first, then push to Google Docs

### File Naming Convention

Google Workspace files: `Richer_<Document-Type>_YYYY-MM-DD`
