**Health and Social Benefits:** CTAP will materially improve patient access to innovative therapies, enabling patients to participate in clinical trials through substantially compressed timelines. Building on Alberta's FAST initiative and the province-wide Advarra OnCore CTMS, trial start-up durations will be reduced from 12-18 months to 45 days or less, with a 78% reduction in AI-enabled screening time, accelerating progression from eligibility to treatment. Through the ACT-AEC network and VITAL/GEMINI—an ISED-funded national federated health data platform spanning Alberta, Ontario, and Quebec—CTAP's integration with Alberta's Connect Care system and AHS Snowflake research data warehouse, combined with an open-source, open-science operating model, will provide a scalable foundation for large, real-world-ready trials across Canada.

**Cloud as Equity Enabler:** CTAP's cloud architecture is not merely a technical choice—it is an equity strategy. Traditional on-premise academic infrastructure creates geographic hierarchies: researchers at major centres have direct access; those at smaller institutions, rural hospitals, and northern communities do not. Cloud-based TRE eliminates this hierarchy. A researcher in Fort McMurray accesses the same infrastructure as a researcher at the University of Alberta. A clinical site in Nunavut participates in trials through the same platform as the Stollery CIU. Indigenous communities maintain data sovereignty through OCAP-compliant governance arrangements that cloud architecture enables.

**Northern Health Security:** The Government of Canada is investing significantly in northern communications infrastructure, framed as national security and defence of the North. CTAP leverages these investments: the TRE works with intermittent connectivity through store-and-forward; telehealth kits designed for infrastructure realism enable trial participation from Nunavut, NWT, and northern Indigenous communities; voice-first AI documentation (AI Scribe) reduces the transcription burden that connectivity-dependent systems impose; OCAP-compliant governance ensures improved connectivity strengthens rather than threatens Indigenous data sovereignty. Data remains in Canadian jurisdiction (AWS Calgary region) under Canadian law.

**Economic Benefits:** CTAP will significantly strengthen Alberta's clinical trials economy and has historically attracted over $100M in pharmaceutical and biotechnology R&D investment across the province. A conservative 10% increase in revenue would generate more than $10M in incremental annual industry research revenue in Alberta by 2031. The CRAIDL intellectual property portfolio—comprising eight AI agents, curated training datasets, and interoperable APIs—will be deployed nationally through open-source licensing to maximise adoption, interoperability, and downstream innovation. In parallel, CTAP will train more than 100 highly qualified personnel (HQP), with at least 20% from underrepresented groups, equipping Canada's workforce with globally competitive expertise in AI-enabled clinical trials, regulatory science, and translational research operations.

**National Leadership and System Impact:** CTAP will serve as a national anchor for major clinical trials and research networks, including ACT-AEC, the PRAIRIE Hub, RareKids-CAN, Connect1D Canada, and VITAL. By releasing CRAIDL agents as open-source infrastructure, CTAP democratizes access to advanced trial design and execution capabilities, enabling participation by smaller centres, Indigenous communities, and rural hospitals nationwide, and reinforcing Canada's leadership in equitable, AI-native clinical research.
