## Budget Reconciliation Issues

### Discrepancy Analysis

| Item | Amount |
|------|--------|
| RTA Narrative Opening (rta.md:46) | $12.4M |
| RTA Section 6 Total (rta.md:314) | $12,235,000 |
| Suite Totals (this document) | $12,105,000 |
| equipment.csv calculated total | TBD (run SQL) |

### Suite 1 Discrepancy

- **Calculated:** $3,004,000
- **Stated in tracker:** $2,904,000
- **Difference:** $100,000 over
- **Action:** Review Autonomic Lab items for consolidation or removal

### Recommendations

1. Reconcile Suite 1 total (remove $100K or adjust stated total)
2. Align RTA narrative figures with final budget
3. Add 13% contingency to final total for renovation reserve
4. Confirm envelope amount with RAS-IP before finalizing
