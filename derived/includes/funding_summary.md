## Sustainability

CTAP operates as an institutional core-facility infrastructure with a diversified sustainability model:

**Infrastructure Operating Fund (IOF):** CFI's IOF provides ongoing support for equipment maintenance, technical personnel, and operational costs—the initial sustainability mechanism for CFI-funded infrastructure.

**Cost-Recovery Services:**

| Service                                      | Fee Structure                                                |
| -------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Biobanking                                   | $35/sample processing + $5-15/year storage                   |
| Clinical trial facilities                    | Challenge Trial Unit, Rare Disease Trial Unit, ADI Clinical Research Unit, CIU facility fees |
| Industry feasibility queries                 | $2,500/query                                                 |
| TRE workspace provisioning                   | $15,000/study-year                                           |
| Industry clinical trial revenue and overhead | 20% increase in clinical trials would bring $6 million in increased revenue |

**Grant Funding:** Ongoing support through Alberta Innovates, CIHR, and NFRF competitions—CTAP infrastructure enables competitive applications across these programs. Increased opportunities to leverage national programs through PRAIRIE Hub, ACT-AEC, RareKids-CAN.

**Institutional Commitments:** The University of Alberta and College of Health Sciences have committed to allocating and maintaining space in the Kipnes Health Research Academy for the Kipnes Health Research Institute, providing base support for key personnel (Program Director, Operations Manager, Data Architect), and integrating CTAP into institutional strategic plans and core-facility frameworks.
