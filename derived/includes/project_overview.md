Advances in artificial intelligence, molecular biology, and biomanufacturing have dramatically expanded the pipeline of candidate vaccines, biologics, and cell therapies. Yet the fundamental constraint on patient benefit remains unchanged: **the speed, cost, and system-level integration of human clinical trials**. Although AI-enabled tools can reduce eligibility screening time by up to 78% and achieve over 90% sensitivity in patient identification, these capabilities are typically deployed in isolation, addressing discrete steps rather than the trial lifecycle as a whole. **This fragmentation—rather than limitations in AI performance—has become the dominant barrier to translating scientific advances into real-world patient impact.**

Addressing this challenge requires more than incremental optimisation. It requires integration. The Clinical Trials Acceleration Platform (CTAP) is Canada's first **AI-native clinical trials infrastructure**, purpose-built as a unified, end-to-end system and embedded directly within a provincial health system. CTAP reframes clinical trials not as episodic, stand-alone projects, but as a continuously learning ecosystem in which clinical data, biospecimens, and operational intelligence are systematically integrated and reinvested to accelerate subsequent discovery, validation, and translation.

CTAP is anchored within the newly established **Dianne and Irving Kipnes Health Research Institute**, whose vision—*"Alberta will be the place where research discoveries reach patients in our communities not in decades, but in years or even months"*—defines the platform's mission. This $25 million philanthropic investment signals a deep institutional commitment to accelerating clinical trials and translating knowledge into impact.

The platform operates through five tightly integrated infrastructure suites:

1. **Clinical Trials Participant & Procedure Infrastructure** - Physical clinical trials infrastructure including Challenge Trial Unit and Pediatric Rare Disease Unit
2. **Living Biorepository** - Intelligent biospecimen management with real-time EMR linkage via Connect Care FHIR API, automated outcome annotation, and consent-aware sample routing
3. **Translational Science Integration** - Trial-to-facility interface layer connecting clinical trials with world-class omics infrastructure (Cryo-EM, Glycomics, Metabolomics)
4. **Data Platform, Secure Environments, AI/HPC** - Three-zone Trusted Research Environment (TRE) and CRAIDL AI agents for end-to-end trial automation
5. **Trial Innovation Tools & Wearables** - Decentralized, patient-centric trial infrastructure with eConsent, wearables, and telehealth for equity

**Total CFI Request: $11,591,000 CAD** (40% CFI + 60% matching)
