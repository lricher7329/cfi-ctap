## Suite 3: Clinical Trials Omics Integration Hub

**Budget: $1,700,000**

Suite 3 provides the **trial-to-facility interface layer**—standardized protocols, quality systems, and data pipelines that connect clinical trial operations with the University of Alberta's world-class omics infrastructure. Rather than duplicating existing excellence, Suite 3 makes it accessible to clinical research.

### Key Components

* **Protocol Integration Services ($300K)** - Standardized SOPs, consent modules, and sample handling protocols for seamless omics endpoint integration

* **Quality Bridge Infrastructure ($500K)** - Pre-analytical QC systems and cold-chain logistics ensuring samples meet facility quality requirements

* **Data Return Pipeline ($250K)** - ETL pipelines and OMOP molecular extensions integrating facility outputs with trial data

* **ACE Core Access & Coordination ($150K)** - Reserved capacity for single-cell and spatial transcriptomics (10x Chromium X, MERSCOPE)

* **High-Throughput Clinical Instrumentation ($500K)** - Equipment bridging the throughput gap between discovery-mode and clinical trial timelines:
  - Rapid Proteomics System (Bruker timsTOF HT): 50+ samples/day vs current 20/week
  - Clinical Metabolomics LC-MS/MS: 15 min/sample vs current 24h/sample
  - High-Throughput Glycan Profiler: Automated batch QC for biologics trials

### Why Clinical-Mode Matters

Discovery omics prioritizes depth; clinical trials prioritize speed. A Phase I dose-escalation trial cannot wait 2 weeks for metabolomics—the next cohort is already enrolling. High-throughput instrumentation enables same-day biomarker feedback within decision windows.

### Partner Facilities

| Facility | Capability | CTAP Integration |
|----------|------------|------------------|
| ACE Core | Single-cell, spatial transcriptomics | Trial sample priority access |
| Alberta Cryo-EM | Atomic-scale imaging | Structural biology endpoints |
| GlycoNet | Glycan profiling | Biologics QC correlation |
| TMIC | Metabolomics (50K samples/year) | PK/PD biomarkers |
| Alberta Proteomics (APM) | Protein identification | Treatment response markers |

### Objectives Supported

- **Objective 3**: Molecular characterization of novel therapeutics
- **Objective 4**: Multi-omics data linked to biospecimens and outcomes
- **Objective 5**: Omics data feeds AI models for biomarker discovery

### Sample Flow

```
Trial → Quality Bridge → Partner Facility → Data Return Pipeline → Suite 4 TRE → CRAIDL Analysis
```

This infrastructure transforms clinical trials from endpoint-focused studies into mechanistic discovery engines, with turnaround times that match clinical decision cycles.
