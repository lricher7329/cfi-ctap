## Suite 1: High-Consequence Interventional Infrastructure

 **Budget: $3,004,000**

 This suite establishes the **specialized high-consequence environments** required for advanced interventional trials that cannot be safely conducted in standard clinical settings. It upgrades existing research units to support **Level 2+ containment** for vaccine challenge trials, **long-term gene therapy monitoring**, **complex cell therapy infusions**, and **autonomic function clinical trials**.

 Key differentiators include:
 - Western Canada's first academic **Vaccine Challenge Trial Unit**, supporting Dr. Michael Houghton's (Nobel laureate 2020) Hepatitis C vaccine program and pandemic preparedness
 - A dedicated **Pediatric Rare Disease Clinical Trials Unit** at the Stollery Children's Hospital, serving as the Western anchor for the national RareKids-CAN network
 - **Autonomic Function Laboratories** (adult and pediatric) supporting Long COVID, POTS, and diabetic neuropathy clinical trials
 
 ### Key Components
 
 * **High-Consequence Interventional Environment** - Creation of specialized procedure suites with negative-pressure capability, infection control airlocks, and advanced monitoring bays for high-risk interventions (e.g., live pathogen challenges, first-in-human cell therapies).

* **Participant Monitoring Equipment** - Vital sign monitors, ECG, programmable infusion pumps, crash carts, and resuscitation equipment for complex therapeutic trials

* **Point-of-Care Laboratory** - Analyzers for rapid safety labs including blood gases, basic CHEM/HEM, and coagulation testing to enable same-day safety assessments

* **Investigational Product Pharmacy** - Secure IP pharmacy freezers/fridges with temperature monitoring and automated dispensing cabinets for cell therapies and biologics

* **Vaccine Challenge Trial Unit** - Four negative-pressure isolation rooms (-25 Pa) with en-suite facilities, airlock entry, HEPA filtration (≥12 ACH), continuous monitoring stations, and BSL-2+ pathogen preparation area. Each room is designed for extended-stay quarantine (14+ days) with in-room entertainment, meal delivery, and 24/7 nursing coverage. Enables controlled human infection model (CHIM) studies for accelerated vaccine evaluation.

  **Digital Integration:** The Challenge Unit functions as a sensor-rich clinical environment. Continuous physiological monitoring (heart rate, temperature, SpO2, ECG) streams to Suite 4's TRE, where the Events Agent monitors for predefined safety thresholds. Participant symptom diaries are captured via Suite 5's mobile app and transcribed by AI Scribe for automated adverse event coding. This transforms controlled infection studies into living data assets for CRAIDL training.

* **Pediatric Rare Disease Clinical Trials Unit** - Located at Stollery Children's Hospital CIU (one of only 2 Canadian pediatric Phase I sites). Includes pediatric vital sign monitors, infusion pumps, long-term monitoring stations (15+ year gene therapy follow-up), and telehealth capability for remote patient access. $200,000 Stollery Foundation contribution supplements $200,000 CTAP investment for family-friendly spaces.

  **Digital Integration:** Genomic characterization flows to Suite 3's omics pipeline for molecular endpoint analysis. Natural history data from Connect Care feeds the Protocol Agent, enabling AI-assisted rare disease trial design. Longitudinal gene therapy outcomes link automatically to provincial health records via Suite 4's TRE, enabling 15-year safety follow-up without manual chart abstraction.

* **Autonomic Function Laboratories** - Research-grade autonomic testing infrastructure at adult (Kaye Edmonton Clinic) and pediatric (Stollery Hospital 1D) labs. Equipment includes tilt tables, QSART systems, continuous BP monitors (Finapres), transcranial Doppler, and NIRS for cerebral autoregulation. Supports Dr. Lawrence Richer's Long COVID taurine trial ([NCT06721949](https://www.clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06721949)) and autonomic dysfunction clinical trials.

  **Digital Integration:** Tilt table and Finapres data streams to Suite 4's TRE for pattern recognition and digital biomarker extraction. Autonomic waveforms become training data for the Events Agent's safety monitoring algorithms. Connect Care integration enables longitudinal outcome linkage—correlating acute autonomic dysfunction with 5-year cardiovascular outcomes without participant re-contact.

### Objectives Supported

- **Objective 1**: Reducing trial startup timelines through purpose-built facilities and network integration (RareKids-CAN)
- **Objective 2**: Enabling efficient recruitment through patient-friendly spaces
- **Objective 3**: First-in-human trials requiring specialized monitoring

### Key Personnel

Trial coordinators, research nurses, and clinical investigators from UACT will operate this infrastructure, with pharmacy oversight for investigational products. The Challenge Trial Unit integrates with Dr. Michael Houghton's Li Ka Shing Applied Virology Institute team for protocol development. The Pediatric Rare Disease Unit is led by Dr. Todd Alexander (Rare Disease Trials Lead) and Christine Westerlund (Stollery CIU Operations), with genomic characterization support from WCHRI's Translational Genomics Hub.
