# Overview

!include ../includes/suite_3_description.md

# Strategic Context

Suite 3 connects CTAP's clinical trials to Alberta's world-class molecular characterization infrastructure. Rather than shipping samples externally, this suite enables real-time correlation of clinical outcomes with mechanistic molecular changes—providing insights that standard trials cannot match.

# Partner Facilities

|----------|------------|------------------|
| **Alberta Cryo-EM Facility** | Atomic-resolution imaging (Titan Krios G4) | Structure-based drug design from trial samples |
| **Glycomics Institute of Alberta (GIA)** | Glycan profiling and screening | Biomarker discovery for immune responses |
| **TMIC Metabolomics** | 2,000+ metabolite identification | Pharmacodynamic endpoints |
| **Alberta Proteomics (APM)** | Protein identification | Mechanism of action studies |
