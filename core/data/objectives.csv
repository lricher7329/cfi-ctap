1,1,Reduce clinical trial start-up timelines by 40-50%,"Reduce clinical trial start-up timelines for UofA-led trials through streamlined UACT processes, harmonized SOPs, and embedded provincial workflows—with a stretch goal of idea to first site activation within 4 weeks via AI-augmented design.",Applied AI Innovation in Healthcare,"Target: startup time reduced from 12+ months to 6 months; benchmark against RECOVERY trial","Median start-up time reduced from ≥12 months to ≤6 months; ≥10% of eligible trials achieve ≤4-week activation; benchmarking against RECOVERY-style trials.",2031,Planned
2,2,Double trial recruitment efficiency,"Double trial recruitment efficiency and create a patient engagement model that serves as a national resource, with explicit targets for Indigenous (15%), rural (20%), and pediatric participation.",All flagship programs,"Target: patient engagement model adopted by 3+ national networks","≥2× recruitment rate relative to baseline; ≥15% Indigenous participation; ≥20% rural participation; patient engagement model adopted by ≥3 national networks.",2031,Planned
3,3,Enable first-in-human and advanced-therapy trials,"Enable first-in-human and advanced-therapy trials through Canada's first academic human challenge facility, integrated cell therapy manufacturing (ACTM), and the API biomanufacturing partnership—creating a complete discovery-to-production pathway.","Neuro-immunology/MS Cell Therapies; Hepatitis C/Vaccines","Target: 5+ first-in-human trials including 2+ vaccine challenge studies; 3+ cell therapy trials; 2+ products advancing to CMPC scale-up","≥5 first-in-human trials conducted; ≥2 spin-out or licensing arrangements; demonstrated regulatory readiness for cell and gene therapies.",2031,Planned
4,4,Integrate biospecimens multi-omics and real-world data,"Integrate biospecimens, multi-omics, and real-world data so that 70%+ of interventional trials have pre-planned biospecimen pipelines, FAIR-compliant data, and RWD-based follow-up linked to Connect Care. Manufacturing batch QC specimens archived for outcome correlation.",All flagship programs,"Target: batch-to-outcome traceability for 100% of API-manufactured products","≥70% of interventional trials with pre-planned biospecimen pipelines; 100% FAIR compliance; ≥5–10 year longitudinal follow-up via Connect Care.",2031,Planned
5,5,Embed AI across trial design enrollment monitoring and analysis,"Embed AI across trial design, enrollment, monitoring, and analysis, creating a continuously learning clinical trials system with 8 deployable CRAIDL agents accessible as national infrastructure via ACT-AEC. Living Digital Twin integrates trial outcomes with API's QSP platform. PHAIR Lab leads implementation science research.",Applied AI Innovation in Healthcare,"Target: 8 agents deployed; adopted by 5+ institutions; implementation science publications","≥6 CRAIDL agents operational; full audit logging and 21 CFR Part 11 compliance; adoption by ≥5 institutions via ACT-AEC; ≥10 implementation science publications.",2031,Planned
6,6,Establish pandemic preparedness clinical validation capacity,"Establish pandemic preparedness clinical validation capacity through the Challenge Trial Unit, supporting PRAIRIE Hub vaccine programs (saRNA platform, Comparative Vaccine Platform) with human challenge studies that provide efficacy signals in months rather than years.","Hepatitis C/Vaccine Trials; PRAIRIE Hub","Target: 3+ controlled human infection model protocols validated; surge capacity for outbreak response","≥3 CHIM protocols validated and operational; demonstrated surge capacity for outbreak response; integration with PRAIRIE Hub vaccine development pipeline.",2031,Planned
7,7,Create a nationally interoperable clinical trials backbone,"Create a nationally interoperable clinical trials backbone serving as a Western anchor for ACT-AEC, PRAIRIE Hub, and RareKids-CAN, with 10+ institutional partners. CTAP functions as the clinical validation engine connecting PRAIRIE Hub discoveries to API manufacturing to production.",All flagship programs,"Target: 10+ institutional partners; Western Canadian coordination role","≥10 institutional partners connected; participation in OHDSI federation (100+ global sites); operational intra-Alberta data sharing via federated queries.",2031,Planned
