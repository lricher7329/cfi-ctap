## Key Concepts

### Living Biorepository (Suite 2)
CTAP introduces the "Living Biorepository" concept - biospecimens that are continuously linked to evolving EMR data, enabling outcome tracking, predictive inventory management, and consent-aware sample routing.

### Unified Data Architecture (Suite 4)
Suite 4 implements a unified data architecture integrating:
- Three-zone Trusted Research Environment (TRE)
- OMOP Common Data Model for federation
- CRAIDL AI agent framework with defined data access patterns
- Regulatory compliance (21 CFR 11, CDISC, HIA)
