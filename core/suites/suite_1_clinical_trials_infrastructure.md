# Suite 1: Clinical Trials Participant & Procedure Infrastructure

## Concise Technical Specification

**Budget: \$3,004,000 CAD**

**Version:** 1.3 **Date:** January 2026

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Executive Summary

Suite 1 establishes the physical clinical trials infrastructure required for complex interventional trials, including cell therapy infusions, vaccine administrations, human challenge studies, pediatric rare disease trials, and intensive pharmacokinetic studies. Rather than building de novo facilities, CTAP strategically enhances an **existing network of three established clinical research facilities** operated within the University of Alberta Hospital (Alberta Health Services). - Adult Clinical Investigation Unit (Adult-CIU), the Stollery Children's Hospital (Alberta Health Services) - Pediatric Clinical Investigation Unit (Pediatric-CIU) and the Alberta Diabetes Institute Clinical Research Unit (ADI-CRU).

In addition to upgrading critical equipment in the existing facilities, the following two additional specialised units will be developed with CFI funding, including: - Alberta's first academic **Vaccine Challenge Trial Unit**, supporting Dr. Michael Houghton's (Nobel laureate 2020) Hepatitis C vaccine program and pandemic preparedness through controlled human infection model (CHIM) capability - A dedicated **Pediatric Rare Disease Clinical Trials Unit** at the Stollery Children's Hospital, connecting to the national RareKids-CAN network and leveraging WCHRI's Translational Genomics Hub - Further integration with the **Alberta Diabetes Institute Clinical Research Unit** for metabolic and cardio-renal-metabolic trial support - Further integration with the **Digital Health Unit** for evaluation of novel digital health solutions and platforms

CTAP's IP Pharmacy establishes a direct supply chain with Applied Pharmaceutical Innovation (API), creating Alberta's first integrated trial-to-manufacturing pathway:

**Upstream Supply (API → CTAP):**

| Trial Phase | API Facility | IP Flow | CTAP Function |
|----------------|--------------------|---------------------|----------------|
| **Phase I** | DDIC (Drug Development and Innovation Centre) | Investigational formulations, cGMP small batches | First-in-human dosing at CIU |
| **Phase II/III** | CMPC (Critical Medicines Production Centre) | Scale-up manufacturing, larger batch production | Multi-site trial supply management |
| **Post-Market** | CMPC | Commercial supply | Real-world evidence collection |

**Batch Traceability Integration:**

The IP Pharmacy's automated dispensing cabinet integrates with Suite 4's OMOP manufacturing extension (see RTA Section 2.2.1) to maintain complete batch-to-participant traceability:

1.  **Receipt**: API manufacturing batches enter CTAP IP Pharmacy with batch certificates
2.  **Storage**: Temperature-monitored storage with batch-specific location tracking
3.  **Dispensing**: Automated cabinet records batch_id linked to participant drug_exposure
4.  **Accountability**: Complete chain of custody supporting Health Canada Division 5 and GMP requirements

**Cold Chain Coordination:**

For temperature-sensitive biologics and cell therapies, IP Pharmacy coordinates with:

-   **ACTM (7th-8th floors, Li Ka Shing Centre)**: Cell therapy products for MS and gene therapy trials
-   **Edmonton International Airport**: Pharmaceutical cold storage facility for incoming/outgoing IP shipments
-   **API DDIC/CMPC**: Temperature excursion protocols and emergency resupply

This integration positions CTAP as the clinical validation gateway for products manufactured in Alberta's biomanufacturing ecosystem.

### 2.5 Vaccine Challenge Trial Unit

| Pathogen preparation area | 1 | BSL-2+ biosafety cabinet, validated containment | \$50,000 |

**Challenge Unit Subtotal: \$590,000**

#### 2.5.1 Challenge Unit Siting Strategy

**Preferred Location: Li Ka Shing Centre for Health Research Innovation**

The Challenge Unit is proposed for co-location with the Li Ka Shing Applied Virology Institute, enabling direct integration with Dr. Michael Houghton's hepatitis C vaccine program. The Li Ka Shing Centre provides foundational infrastructure:

| Factor | Li Ka Shing Centre Assessment |
|-------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| **Virology Institute proximity** | Same building as Dr. Houghton's laboratory |
| **Existing BSL capability** | BSL-2 and BSL-3 containment laboratories operational |
| **Air handling infrastructure** | Building designed for containment; adaptable |
| **Hospital proximity** | 240m to UAH; adequate for emergency response |
| **Decision authority** | University of Alberta Facilities & Operations |
| **cGMP adjacency** | ACTM cell manufacturing on 7th-8th floors |

**Alternative Location: Kipnes Health Research Academy**

Kipness Health Research Academy may be an alternative site, but requires exploration.

**Siting Comparison:**

| Criterion | Li Ka Shing Centre | Kipnes Academy | Adult CIU (UAH) |
|----------------------|-----------------|-----------------|-----------------|
| Virology alignment | Excellent | Poor | Poor |
| BSL infrastructure | Existing | Poor | Limited |
| Isolation room design | Renovation | Renovation | Unsuitable |
| Hospital emergency access | Reasonably close | Reasonably close | Immediate |
| Space allocation | Subject to approval | Subject to approval | Not available |

**Why Not the Existing Adult CIU?**

The NACTRC Adult CIU at UAH MacKenzie Centre is unsuitable for challenge trials due to: - 4-bed ward configuration (not single-occupancy isolation rooms with en-suite) - No negative pressure capability - Extended quarantine (14+ days) incompatible with day-procedure design - Major HVAC retrofit would be required

International comparators (Royal Free Hospital London, hVivo Canary Wharf) use purpose-designed containment facilities, not adapted clinical units.

#### 2.5.2 Challenge Unit Risk Analysis

**Space Allocation Dependency:**

The Challenge Unit (\$590,000) requires dedicated space with negative pressure isolation capability. Space allocation is subject to University of Alberta Facilities approval.

| Risk Element | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|--------------------|------------|------------|----------------------------|
| Space availability at Li Ka Shing | Medium | High | Early engagement with Virology Institute leadership |
| Approval timeline extending beyond RTA | Medium | High | Identify alternative locations (Kipnes) |
| Renovation costs exceeding budget | Low | Medium | Contingency in fit-out allocation |
| Governance complexity | Medium | Medium | Clear MOU with Virology Institute |

**Risk Mitigation Strategies:**

1.  **Modular Presentation**: Challenge Unit presented as distinct component with independent justification
2.  **Contingent Budget**: Budget allocated as contingent pending space confirmation
3.  **Early Engagement**: Initiate discussions with Li Ka Shing Institute leadership and University Facilities
4.  **Phased Approach**: Challenge Unit as Phase 2 if space not confirmed for Phase 1
5.  **Alternative Funding**: Identify complementary funding (Virology Institute, Government of Alberta pandemic preparedness)

**Contingency Statement:**

> The Vaccine Challenge Trial Unit requires dedicated space with negative pressure isolation capability. The preferred location is the Li Ka Shing Centre for Health Research Innovation, co-located with the Li Ka Shing Applied Virology Institute. Space allocation is subject to University approval. If suitable space is not available, the Challenge Unit budget may be reallocated to other Suite 1 components or deferred to a subsequent funding phase.

#### 2.5.3 Extended-Stay Participant Accommodation

Challenge trial participants remain in quarantine for 14+ days (pathogen-dependent, with PCR-negative discharge required). Each of the four isolation rooms functions as a self-contained living unit designed for extended participant comfort while maintaining strict infection control.

**Room Configuration:**

| Requirement | Specification | Included In |
|-------------------|-------------------------------|----------------------|
| Private sleeping area | Hospital-grade bed, quality bedding | Room fit-out (\$300K) |
| En-suite bathroom | Toilet, shower, sink | Room fit-out (\$300K) |
| Entertainment | TV/streaming, WiFi access | Room fit-out (\$300K) |
| Communication | Intercom to nursing station, phone | Monitoring system (\$60K) |
| Meal service | In-room delivery (not communal) | Operational |
| Work surface | Desk area for extended stay comfort | Room fit-out (\$300K) |

**Space Requirements (per room):**

| Area                        | Size        | Total (4 rooms) |
|-----------------------------|-------------|-----------------|
| Sleeping/living area        | \~15 m²     | 60 m²           |
| En-suite bathroom           | \~5 m²      | 20 m²           |
| Airlock entry               | \~3 m²      | 12 m²           |
| **Total participant space** | **\~23 m²** | **\~92 m²**     |

**Shared Infrastructure:** - Nursing station: \~15 m² - Pathogen preparation area: \~20 m² (BSL-2+) - Staff PPE donning/doffing: \~10 m² - Storage/utilities: \~15 m²

**Total Challenge Unit Footprint:** \~150-175 m² (estimated)

**Design Rationale:**

The clinical-only accommodation model follows international exemplars (Royal Free Hospital London, hVivo): - Each room is self-contained; participants remain isolated for entire quarantine period - **No communal areas** (kitchen, lounge, recreation) are included—this would compromise infection control - Meals are delivered to rooms; staff enter through airlock in full PPE - Entertainment and communication are provided via in-room systems - 24/7 nursing coverage with continuous telemetry monitoring

**Budget Coverage:**

These extended-stay requirements are included within the existing Challenge Unit budget (\$590,000). The \$400,000 "Challenge Unit Renovation & Construction" (Equipment ID 38) encompasses structural work for isolation rooms, en-suite bathroom plumbing, airlock construction, HVAC modifications, and all participant comfort amenities.

### 2.6 Pediatric Rare Disease Clinical Trials Unit

Located at the Stollery Children's Hospital Clinical Investigation Unit (Oilers Ambulatory Clinic), this unit provides specialized infrastructure for pediatric rare disease trials, including gene therapy and cell therapy studies requiring long-term (15+ year) follow-up.

| Telehealth/remote monitoring | 1 | For follow-up visits, family convenience | \$30,000 |
| Data integration (Connect Care) | 1 | EDC/CDASH linkage for rare disease registry | \$30,000 |

**CTAP Investment: \$200,000**

**Stollery Foundation In-Kind Contribution (\$200,000):** - Pediatric infusion suite fit-out (2 bays): \$80,000 - Child-friendly procedure room: \$60,000 - Family accommodation space: \$30,000 - Parent amenities (lactation, snacks, respite): \$30,000

**Total Unit Value: \$400,000** (50% CTAP, 50% Stollery)

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 3. Challenge Trial Unit: Background and Rationale

### 3.1 What are Human Challenge Trials?

Human challenge trials (also called Controlled Human Infection Models - CHIMs) deliberately expose healthy volunteers to pathogens under controlled conditions to accelerate vaccine and therapeutic development. Key advantages include:

-   **Accelerated efficacy signals**: 10-100x faster than traditional field trials
-   **Smaller participant numbers**: Tens of participants vs. thousands
-   **Mechanistic insights**: Precise understanding of infection dynamics and immune responses
-   **Pandemic preparedness**: Rapid evaluation of candidate vaccines and therapeutics

Challenge trials have been instrumental in developing vaccines for influenza, malaria, typhoid, cholera, and most recently COVID-19. The UK's COVID-19 human challenge study (2021) at Imperial College London was the world's first for SARS-CoV-2.

### 3.2 International Exemplars and Standards

**United Kingdom (World Leader):**

| Facility | Capacity | Biosafety | Key Features |
|-----------------------------|-------------|-------------|-----------------|
| [hVIVO](https://hvivo.com/) | 150+ beds (UK/Germany) | BSL-3 certified | World's largest commercial operator; 50-bed quarantine unit |
| [Imperial College London](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/infectious-disease/research/human-challenge/) | Variable | CL3 capable | Led world's first COVID-19 challenge study |
| Royal Free Hospital | Specialist unit | Secure containment | COVID-19 challenge study partner |
| Chelsea & Westminster | Ron Johnson Ward | Quarantine capable | COVID-19 COVHIC002 study site |
| hVIVO Canary Wharf | Largest globally | CL3 | Purpose-built 2023; highest hospital isolation standards |

**Academic Centres Conducting CHIMs:** - Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine (malaria, typhoid) - Oxford University (influenza, typhoid) - University of Maryland (cholera, norovirus) - Kenya Medical Research Institute (malaria)

### 3.3 Facility Design Requirements

Based on international standards and [UK Day One analysis](https://ukdayone.org/briefings/making-the-uk-the-global-centre-for-challenge-trials):

| Requirement | Specification | CTAP Implementation |
|------------------|-----------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Biosafety level** | BSL-2 minimum; BSL-3 for high-consequence pathogens | BSL-2+ (upgradeable) |
| **Pressure differential** | Negative pressure -25 to -30 Pa (10x CDC minimum) | -25 Pa with continuous monitoring |
| **Air changes** | ≥10-12 ACH with HEPA filtration | ≥12 ACH, HEPA exhaust |
| **Room configuration** | En-suite bathroom, airlock entry | Single-occupancy with interlocking doors |
| **Monitoring** | 24/7 medical staff, telemetry, video | Continuous vital signs, crash cart access |
| **Quarantine duration** | 14+ days typical | Protocol-dependent, PCR-negative discharge |
| **Waste handling** | Category A/infectious waste capability | Autoclave access, specialized disposal |

### 3.4 Regulatory Pathway

**Health Canada:** - No specific CHIM guidance currently exists - Standard Clinical Trial Application (CTA) process applies under [Food and Drug Regulations Part C, Division 5](https://www.canada.ca/en/health-canada/services/drugs-health-products/drug-products/applications-submissions/guidance-documents/clinical-trials/clinical-trial-sponsors-applications.html) - Pre-submission meeting recommended for novel challenge protocols - 30-day authorization period for CTA review

**International Standards:** - [WHO Guidance: Human challenge trials for vaccine development (TRS 1004, Annex 10)](https://www.who.int/publications/m/item/human-challenge-trials-for-vaccine-a10-trs-no-1004) - ICH E6(R2) Good Clinical Practice - Declaration of Helsinki ethical requirements - Special ethics review for controlled infection studies

**Canada's Current Gap:** Canada has NO dedicated challenge trial facilities. CTAP would establish the first academic capability, positioning Alberta and Canada as leaders in accelerated vaccine development.

### 3.5 Michael Houghton and Li Ka Shing Institute Integration

**Dr. Michael Houghton:** - [Nobel laureate 2020](https://www.ualberta.ca/en/michael-houghton-nobel-prize-2020.html) (Physiology or Medicine) for discovery of Hepatitis C virus - Li Ka Shing Professor of Virology, University of Alberta - Director, [Li Ka Shing Applied Virology Institute](https://www.ualberta.ca/en/li-ka-shing-institute-virology/li-ka-shing-applied-virology-institute/about-avi/director.html) - Developing [HCV vaccine](https://www.ualberta.ca/en/folio/2012/02/hep-c-vaccine-breakthrough.html) effective against all global strains - Only second Nobel Prize in Physiology/Medicine awarded to a professor at a Canadian university (first since Banting/MacLeod 1923)

**Li Ka Shing Institute of Virology:** - Established 2010 with \$28M Li Ka Shing Foundation gift + \$52.5M Government of Alberta - World-leading virology research capacity - Natural partner for challenge trial protocol development - Links to PRAIRIE Hub pandemic preparedness infrastructure

**Hepatitis C Vaccine Program:** Dr. Houghton's HCV vaccine has demonstrated cross-neutralizing activity against all major HCV genotypes in preclinical studies. A human challenge trial capability would enable: - Phase I safety evaluation with controlled HCV exposure - Immune response characterization with precise infection timing - Accelerated pathway to Phase II/III field trials

### 3.6 PRAIRIE Hub Vaccine Programs as Challenge Trial Unit Feeders

The Challenge Trial Unit completes Alberta's integrated vaccine development pipeline by providing clinical validation for two major PRAIRIE Hub sub-programs funded through the Canadian Biomanufacturing and Research Fund (CBRF/BRIF):

#### Sub-Program 1: Self-Amplifying RNA Vaccine Platform (\$35.3M, Houghton)

**Scientific Lead:** Dr. Michael Houghton (Nobel laureate 2020), Director, Li Ka Shing Applied Virology Institute

This program develops **self-amplifying RNA (saRNA)** vaccines—an evolution of mRNA technology with significant manufacturing and deployment advantages:

| Feature | saRNA Advantage | Challenge Trial Relevance |
|------------------|---------------------|---------------------------------|
| **Dose** | \~10× lower than conventional mRNA | Smaller challenge cohorts needed for efficacy signal |
| **Manufacturing yield** | Dramatically higher doses per batch | Faster scale-up after Challenge Unit validation |
| **Reactogenicity** | Potentially fewer side effects | Improved safety profile for healthy volunteer challenges |
| **Global scalability** | Easier rapid deployment | Pandemic surge capacity through CMPC |

**Target Pathogens (High Pandemic Potential):**

| Pathogen Class | Vaccine Platform | CTAP Challenge Potential |
|-----------------|-----------------|--------------------------------------|
| **Influenza (H5N1)** | saRNA | WHO-approved CHIM models; attenuated strain challenges |
| **Orthopoxviruses** | saRNA | Modified vaccinia Ankara challenge; established protocols |
| **Arenaviruses** | saRNA | Research-stage models; biosafety level dependent |
| **Hepatitis C** | Recombinant protein | World's first HCV CHIM (Nobel-enabled discovery) |

**Explicit API Partnership:** Applied Pharmaceutical Innovation is a named industry partner in the Houghton program, linking saRNA process development directly to GMP translation and CMPC manufacturing.

#### Sub-Program 2: Comparative Vaccine Platform Program (\$57M, Shmulevitz/Pelka)

**Scientific Leads:**

-   Dr. Maya Shmulevitz (Canada Research Chair in Molecular Virology and Oncology, U of A)
-   Dr. Peter Pelka (University of Manitoba)

This program systematically compares vaccine delivery platforms to determine optimal approaches for different pathogen classes and populations:

| Platform Under Evaluation | Challenge Trial Application |
|------------------------------------------|------------------------------|
| **Live attenuated virus** | Measles-like CHIM protocols |
| **Viral vectors** (adenovirus-based) | Established COVID-19 challenge experience |
| **Whole inactivated virus** | Influenza CHIM models |
| **Recombinant protein** | HCV challenge (Houghton program synergy) |
| **Alternative delivery routes** (intranasal, inhaled) | Mucosal immunity assessment via CHIM |

**Strategic Differentiators:**

1.  **Head-to-head platform comparison** informs which candidates advance to Challenge Unit
2.  **Advanced immune profiling** (mucosal vs systemic, durability, immunocompromised populations)
3.  **Manufacturability lens**: Which platforms scale fastest? Which are most robust to supply-chain disruption?

**Challenge Unit Value:** The Shmulevitz program functions as a **national decision-support engine** for vaccine platform investment—de-risking Challenge Unit protocol selection and downstream CMPC manufacturing scale-up.

#### Integrated Discovery-to-Manufacturing Pathway

**Why Challenge Trials Accelerate Both Programs:**

-   **Houghton saRNA Program**: Challenge trials provide efficacy signals 10-100× faster than field trials, enabling rapid iteration on saRNA formulations
-   **Shmulevitz Comparative Program**: Head-to-head CHIM studies directly compare platform immunogenicity with precise infection timing—data impossible to obtain from field trials

**Manufacturing Lot Tracking:**

For PRAIRIE Hub vaccine candidates manufactured at ACTM and tested in the Challenge Trial Unit:

-   Manufacturing batch numbers link to CTAP IP Pharmacy dispensing records
-   Challenge dose timing and immune response data flow to Suite 4's OMOP manufacturing extension
-   Batch-to-efficacy correlations inform CMPC scale-up manufacturing parameters

**Pandemic Preparedness Value:**

This integrated pathway—unique in Canada—enables rapid vaccine evaluation: when a novel pathogen emerges, PRAIRIE Hub can develop candidates (saRNA or optimal platform from Shmulevitz program), ACTM can manufacture clinical lots, and CTAP can provide efficacy signals through CHIM studies within months rather than years. The 70 million dose annual capacity at CMPC then enables population-scale production.

**Alberta's Strategic Position:** Together, the Houghton and Shmulevitz programs position Alberta as **Canada's vaccine engine**, with CTAP's Challenge Trial Unit providing the critical clinical validation capability that connects upstream discovery to downstream manufacturing.

### 3.7 Strategic Value

| Dimension | Benefit |
|-------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| **Scientific** | Precise mechanistic studies impossible in field trials |
| **Economic** | Reduced trial costs (smaller N, shorter duration) |
| **Speed** | Months instead of years for efficacy signals |
| **Pandemic readiness** | Rapid vaccine evaluation capability |
| **National positioning** | Canada's first; attracts international pharma partnerships |
| **Nobel integration** | Dr. Houghton's vaccine program enabled by infrastructure |

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 4. Pediatric Rare Disease Unit: Background and Rationale

### 4.1 The Rare Disease Challenge

Rare diseases affect **1 in 12 Canadians**, with approximately 7,000 known rare diseases—yet only \~5% have approved treatments. Rare disease clinical trials have unique infrastructure requirements:

-   **Small patient populations**: Often require multi-site, multi-national coordination
-   **Pediatric predominance**: \~50% of rare disease patients are children
-   **Complex phenotyping**: Deep clinical characterization and genomic workups needed
-   **Long-term follow-up**: Gene therapy trials require extended observation (FDA mandates 15+ years)
-   **Family-centered care**: Parents/caregivers are integral to trial participation

### 4.2 Canadian Rare Disease Networks

[**RareKids-CAN Network**](https://lab.research.sickkids.ca/enrich/research-projects/rarekids-can/)**:** - Funded early 2024 by CIHR Institute of Genetics as part of Canada's National Strategy for Drugs for Rare Diseases - Collaboration between patient groups, clinicians, researchers, and industry - Goal: Ensure every Canadian child with rare disease has access to effective treatments - the University of Alberta and WCHRI serves as the Data Coordination Center; CTAP provides Western anchor for rare disease clinical trials support and infrastructure 

[**Canadian Rare Disease Network (CRDN)**](https://canadianrdn.ca/)**:** - Launched February 29, 2024 - Brings together patient groups, clinicians, and researchers - Focus: Reducing diagnostic time, expanding treatment, connecting research nationally
