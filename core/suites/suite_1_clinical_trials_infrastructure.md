# Suite 1: Clinical Trials Participant & Procedure Infrastructure

## Concise Technical Specification

**Budget: $3,004,000 CAD** (includes Suite 1a Vaccine Challenge Trial Unit at $590,000)

**Version:** 1.5 **Date:** January 2026

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Executive Summary

Suite 1 establishes the physical clinical trials infrastructure required for complex interventional trials, including cell therapy infusions, vaccine administrations, pediatric rare disease trials, and intensive pharmacokinetic studies. Rather than building de novo facilities, CTAP strategically enhances an **existing network of three established clinical research facilities** operated within the University of Alberta Hospital (Alberta Health Services). - Adult Clinical Investigation Unit (Adult-CIU), the Stollery Children's Hospital (Alberta Health Services) - Pediatric Clinical Investigation Unit (Pediatric-CIU) and the Alberta Diabetes Institute Clinical Research Unit (ADI-CRU).

In addition to upgrading critical equipment in the existing facilities, the following specialized units will be developed with CFI funding:
- A dedicated **Pediatric Rare Disease Clinical Trials Unit** at the Stollery Children's Hospital, connecting to the national RareKids-CAN network and leveraging WCHRI's Translational Genomics Hub
- Further integration with the **Alberta Diabetes Institute Clinical Research Unit** for metabolic and cardio-renal-metabolic trial support
- Further integration with the **Digital Health Unit** for evaluation of novel digital health solutions and platforms

**Note:** The **Vaccine Challenge Trial Unit** (CHIM capability) is presented separately as **Suite 1a** due to its contingent space allocation status. See Suite 1a for details on this $590,000 component supporting Dr. Michael Houghton's (Nobel laureate 2020) Hepatitis C vaccine program and pandemic preparedness.
