# Suite 1a: Vaccine Challenge Trial Unit (Non-Airborne Focus)

## Concise Technical Specification

**Budget: $340,000 CAD**

**Version:** 2.0
**Date:** January 2026
**Status:** Site selection pending

---

## Executive Summary

Suite 1a establishes Alberta's first academic **Vaccine Challenge Trial Unit** (Controlled Human Infection Model - CHIM capability), with a strategic focus on **non-airborne pathogens**—specifically supporting Dr. Michael Houghton's (Nobel laureate 2020) Hepatitis C vaccine program and enteric pathogen research. This simplified infrastructure design eliminates the complex negative pressure and airlock requirements associated with airborne pathogen containment, dramatically reducing implementation barriers while maintaining the scientific value of controlled human infection studies.

**Key Design Decision:** By focusing on blood-borne (HCV) and fecal-oral transmitted pathogens (norovirus, typhoid, cholera), CTAP achieves:
- **$650,000 cost reduction** compared to airborne-capable design
- **Elimination of complex HVAC modifications** (no negative pressure, no HEPA exhaust)
- **Simplified regulatory pathway** (standard BSL-2 versus BSL-2+ airborne containment)
- **Faster implementation timeline** (standard clinical renovation versus specialized containment construction)

The $650,000 in savings has been reallocated to the **Amii CRAIDL Partnership** (Suite 4), strengthening CTAP's AI-native platform positioning.

**Site Status:** The preferred location is the Li Ka Shing Centre for Health Research Innovation, co-located with the Li Ka Shing Applied Virology Institute. Alternative locations (Kipnes Health Research Academy) are under exploration. Space allocation is subject to University of Alberta Facilities approval.

## 1. Strategic Rationale: Non-Airborne Focus

### 1.1 Why Non-Airborne?

The decision to focus on non-airborne pathogens reflects both strategic alignment and practical implementation considerations:

**Primary Use Case Alignment:**
- Dr. Michael Houghton's HCV vaccine program is the flagship use case for the Challenge Trial Unit
- **Hepatitis C is a blood-borne pathogen**—transmitted via blood-to-blood contact, not respiratory droplets
- HCV CHIM studies require extended observation (viral dynamics monitoring) but standard clinical air handling

**Global Disease Burden:**
Non-airborne pathogens represent substantial global health challenges with established CHIM protocols:

| Pathogen | Transmission | Global Burden | CHIM Precedent |
|----------|--------------|---------------|----------------|
| **Hepatitis C** | Blood-borne | 58M chronic infections; 1.5M new/year | World's first (Houghton-enabled) |
| **Norovirus** | Fecal-oral | 685M cases/year; 200,000 deaths | UK, US established protocols |
| **Typhoid** | Fecal-oral | 11M cases/year; 110,000 deaths | Oxford, Liverpool active |
| **Cholera** | Fecal-oral | 1.3-4M cases/year; 21,000-143,000 deaths | University of Maryland |
| **Campylobacter** | Fecal-oral | 1 in 10 people annually | Established protocols |

**Implementation Simplification:**

| Requirement | Airborne Design | Non-Airborne Design |
|-------------|-----------------|---------------------|
| Air pressure | Negative (-25 Pa) | Neutral (standard) |
| Air handling | ≥12 ACH, HEPA exhaust | Standard 6-8 ACH |
| Room entry | Airlock with interlocking doors | Standard clinical entry |
| PPE requirements | N95/PAPR for staff | Standard precautions |
| Renovation cost | $800,000 | $250,000 |
| HEPA filtration | $80,000 | $0 |
| Regulatory pathway | Complex containment validation | Standard clinical space |

### 1.2 What We Preserve

The non-airborne design retains all essential CHIM capabilities:

- **Extended-stay participant accommodation** (14+ days) with private rooms and en-suite facilities
- **Continuous clinical monitoring** (telemetry, vital signs, specimen collection)
- **Standard BSL-2 pathogen handling** for blood-borne and enteric agents
- **Challenge trial expertise development** and regulatory navigation
- **PRAIRIE Hub integration** for vaccine platform evaluation

### 1.3 What We Defer

Airborne pathogen capabilities (influenza H5N1, orthopoxviruses, respiratory challenges) are **deferred** to future phases. This could be achieved through:
- Partnership with existing airborne CHIM facilities (hVivo UK, Imperial College)
- Future CFI or pandemic preparedness funding for airborne upgrade
- Provincial pandemic preparedness investment if required

**Total: $340,000**

### 2.2 Extended-Stay Participant Accommodation

Challenge trial participants remain in observation for 14+ days (pathogen-dependent, with viral clearance confirmation before discharge). Each of the four rooms functions as a self-contained living unit designed for extended participant comfort.

**Room Configuration:**

| Requirement | Specification | Included In |
|-------------|---------------|-------------|
| Private sleeping area | Hospital-grade bed, quality bedding | Room fit-out ($250K) |
| En-suite bathroom | Toilet, shower, sink | Room fit-out ($250K) |
| Entertainment | TV/streaming, WiFi access | Room fit-out ($250K) |
| Communication | Intercom to nursing station, phone | Monitoring system ($60K) |
| Meal service | In-room delivery | Operational |
| Work surface | Desk area for extended stay comfort | Room fit-out ($250K) |

**Space Requirements (per room):**

| Area | Size | Total (4 rooms) |
|------|------|-----------------|
| Sleeping/living area | ~15 m² | 60 m² |
| En-suite bathroom | ~5 m² | 20 m² |
| Entry vestibule | ~2 m² | 8 m² |
| **Total participant space** | **~22 m²** | **~88 m²** |

**Shared Infrastructure:**
- Nursing station: ~15 m²
- Pathogen preparation area: ~15 m² (BSL-2)
- Staff areas: ~10 m²
- Storage/utilities: ~15 m²

**Total Challenge Unit Footprint:** ~140-160 m² (estimated)

**Design Rationale:**

The clinical-only accommodation model follows international exemplars (Royal Free Hospital London, hVivo):
- Each room is self-contained; participants remain in their rooms for the observation period
- Meals are delivered to rooms; staff enter following standard precautions
- Entertainment and communication are provided via in-room systems
- 24/7 nursing coverage with continuous telemetry monitoring

**Non-Airborne Simplification:**
- No airlock entries required—standard clinical door with hand hygiene station
- No HEPA filtration—standard clinical ventilation (6-8 ACH)
- No negative pressure monitoring—neutral room pressure
- Blood/enteric precautions only—no respiratory PPE requirements for staff

## 3. Siting Strategy

### 3.1 Preferred Location: Li Ka Shing Centre for Health Research Innovation

The Challenge Unit is proposed for co-location with the Li Ka Shing Applied Virology Institute, enabling direct integration with Dr. Michael Houghton's hepatitis C vaccine program.

| Factor | Li Ka Shing Centre Assessment |
|--------|------------------------------|
| **Virology Institute proximity** | Same building as Dr. Houghton's laboratory |
| **Existing BSL capability** | BSL-2 and BSL-3 laboratories operational |
| **Air handling infrastructure** | Standard clinical HVAC sufficient for non-airborne |
| **Hospital proximity** | 240m to UAH; adequate for emergency response |
| **Decision authority** | University of Alberta Facilities & Operations |
| **cGMP adjacency** | ACTM cell manufacturing on 7th-8th floors |

### 3.2 Reduced Siting Complexity

The non-airborne design dramatically simplifies site selection:
- **No specialized HVAC modifications required**
- **Standard clinical renovation scope**
- **Compatible with existing building systems**
- **Lower institutional approval barriers**

### 3.3 Alternative Location: Kipnes Health Research Academy

Kipnes Health Research Academy remains an alternative site if Li Ka Shing Centre space is unavailable.

## 4. What are Human Challenge Trials?

Human challenge trials (also called Controlled Human Infection Models - CHIMs) deliberately expose healthy volunteers to pathogens under controlled conditions to accelerate vaccine and therapeutic development. Key advantages include:

- **Accelerated efficacy signals**: 10-100x faster than traditional field trials
- **Smaller participant numbers**: Tens of participants vs. thousands
- **Mechanistic insights**: Precise understanding of infection dynamics and immune responses
- **Pandemic preparedness**: Rapid evaluation of candidate vaccines and therapeutics

Challenge trials have been instrumental in developing vaccines for typhoid, cholera, malaria, and most recently COVID-19. The UK's COVID-19 human challenge study (2021) at Imperial College London demonstrated the value of this approach for respiratory pathogens.

---

## 5. Non-Airborne CHIM Exemplars

### 5.1 Established Programs

| Facility | Pathogen Focus | Key Features |
|----------|----------------|--------------|
| **University of Maryland CVD** | Cholera, norovirus, Campylobacter | 50+ years experience; enteric pathogen pioneer |
| **Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine** | Typhoid, malaria | International leader in enteric/vector challenges |
| **Oxford Vaccine Group** | Typhoid, paratyphoid | Established protocols; regulatory expertise |
| **hVIVO** | Multiple (enteric and respiratory) | Commercial operator; broad pathogen portfolio |

### 5.2 Blood-Borne CHIM Considerations

Hepatitis C challenge trials represent a novel frontier:
- **No established HCV CHIM protocols exist globally**
- Dr. Houghton's vaccine program would pioneer this approach
- Blood-borne transmission requires different safety protocols than respiratory or enteric
- Extended viral monitoring (weeks to months) necessary for HCV dynamics

CTAP's Challenge Unit would position Alberta as the **global leader in HCV human challenge studies**.

---

## 6. Regulatory Pathway

**Health Canada:**
- Standard Clinical Trial Application (CTA) process under [Food and Drug Regulations Part C, Division 5](https://www.canada.ca/en/health-canada/services/drugs-health-products/drug-products/applications-submissions/guidance-documents/clinical-trials/clinical-trial-sponsors-applications.html)
- Pre-submission meeting recommended for novel challenge protocols
- 30-day authorization period for CTA review
- Non-airborne design simplifies facility inspection requirements

**International Standards:**
- [WHO Guidance: Human challenge trials for vaccine development (TRS 1004, Annex 10)](https://www.who.int/publications/m/item/human-challenge-trials-for-vaccine-a10-trs-no-1004)
- ICH E6(R2) Good Clinical Practice
- Declaration of Helsinki ethical requirements
- Special ethics review for controlled infection studies

**Canada's Current Gap:** Canada has NO dedicated challenge trial facilities. CTAP would establish the first academic capability, positioning Alberta and Canada as leaders in accelerated vaccine development for blood-borne and enteric pathogens.

### 14.1 Biologics Infrastructure Synergy with Rare Disease Unit

The Challenge Trial Unit and Pediatric Rare Disease Unit (Suite 1, Section 3.7) share substantial infrastructure requirements for biologics and cell-based therapies. This convergence reflects the evolution of both fields:

**Vaccine Development:** Next-generation vaccines increasingly employ mRNA platforms, viral vectors, and cell-based immunotherapies—modalities that require the same cold chain, infusion, and monitoring infrastructure as gene and cell therapies for rare diseases.

**Shared Infrastructure Benefits:**

| Infrastructure | Challenge Unit Use | Rare Disease Use | Efficiency Gain |
|----------------|-------------------|------------------|-----------------|
| **-80°C/-150°C storage** | mRNA vaccines, viral vectors | Gene therapy vectors, cell products | Single cold chain investment serves both populations |
| **Infusion monitoring** | Post-challenge therapeutics | Gene/cell therapy administration | Shared cardiac/respiratory monitoring, anaphylaxis response |
| **ACTM supply chain** | Cell-based immunotherapy trials | CAR-T, gene-modified cell trials | Common manufacturing pathway from Li Ka Shing 7th-8th floors |
| **Cytokine surveillance** | Vaccine reactogenicity | CAR-T cytokine release syndrome | Shared POC panels, trained nursing staff |

**Sustainability Rationale:** Even at separate sites (Li Ka Shing Centre for Challenge Unit, Stollery for Rare Disease Unit), shared investment in biologics infrastructure—particularly IP pharmacy cold chain, cytokine monitoring capability, and ACTM coordination—distributes fixed costs across a larger trial portfolio. Staff trained in biologics administration serve both programs, and equipment pools (infusion pumps, monitoring systems) can be deployed flexibly based on trial schedules.

This infrastructure synergy strengthens the investment case: CTAP builds biologics capability once to serve the full spectrum of advanced therapy trials, from vaccine challenge studies to pediatric gene therapy.
