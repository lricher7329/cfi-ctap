# Suite 1a: Vaccine Challenge Trial Unit

## Concise Technical Specification

**Budget: $590,000 CAD** (contingent on space allocation)

**Version:** 1.0
**Date:** January 2026
**Status:** Site selection pending

---

## Executive Summary

Suite 1a establishes Alberta's first academic **Vaccine Challenge Trial Unit** (Controlled Human Infection Model - CHIM capability), supporting Dr. Michael Houghton's (Nobel laureate 2020) Hepatitis C vaccine program and pandemic preparedness. This capability is critical for Canada's vaccine development pipeline but **requires dedicated space with negative pressure isolation capability that has not yet been confirmed**.

**Site Status:** The preferred location is the Li Ka Shing Centre for Health Research Innovation, co-located with the Li Ka Shing Applied Virology Institute. Alternative locations (Kipnes Health Research Academy) are under exploration. Space allocation is subject to University of Alberta Facilities approval.

**Strategic Rationale for Separation:** The Challenge Trial Unit is presented as a distinct suite (1a) because:
1. **Space dependency**: Unlike other Suite 1 components that enhance existing facilities, the Challenge Unit requires purpose-built containment space
2. **Contingent funding**: Budget allocation is contingent on space confirmation
3. **Unique regulatory pathway**: CHIM studies have distinct Health Canada requirements
4. **Specialized infrastructure**: Negative pressure isolation is incompatible with standard clinical trial units

## 1. Infrastructure Components

### 1.1 Challenge Unit Core Infrastructure

| Component | Quantity | Specification | Cost |
|-----------------|-------------|-------------------------------|-------------|
| Challenge Unit renovation & construction | 1 | Negative pressure (-25 Pa), 4 isolation rooms with en-suite bathrooms, airlock entries, HVAC modifications | $400,000 |
| HEPA filtration upgrade | 4 rooms | ≥12 ACH, HEPA exhaust, pressure monitoring | $80,000 |
| Continuous monitoring stations | 4 | Telemetry, SpO2, temperature, video surveillance | $60,000 |
| Pathogen preparation area | 1 | BSL-2+ biosafety cabinet, validated containment | $50,000 |

**Total: $590,000**

### 1.2 Extended-Stay Participant Accommodation

Challenge trial participants remain in quarantine for 14+ days (pathogen-dependent, with PCR-negative discharge required). Each of the four isolation rooms functions as a self-contained living unit designed for extended participant comfort while maintaining strict infection control.

**Room Configuration:**

| Requirement | Specification | Included In |
|-------------------|-------------------------------|----------------------|
| Private sleeping area | Hospital-grade bed, quality bedding | Room fit-out ($400K) |
| En-suite bathroom | Toilet, shower, sink | Room fit-out ($400K) |
| Entertainment | TV/streaming, WiFi access | Room fit-out ($400K) |
| Communication | Intercom to nursing station, phone | Monitoring system ($60K) |
| Meal service | In-room delivery (not communal) | Operational |
| Work surface | Desk area for extended stay comfort | Room fit-out ($400K) |

**Space Requirements (per room):**

| Area                        | Size        | Total (4 rooms) |
|-----------------------------|-------------|-----------------|
| Sleeping/living area        | ~15 m²      | 60 m²           |
| En-suite bathroom           | ~5 m²       | 20 m²           |
| Airlock entry               | ~3 m²       | 12 m²           |
| **Total participant space** | **~23 m²**  | **~92 m²**      |

**Shared Infrastructure:**
- Nursing station: ~15 m²
- Pathogen preparation area: ~20 m² (BSL-2+)
- Staff PPE donning/doffing: ~10 m²
- Storage/utilities: ~15 m²

**Total Challenge Unit Footprint:** ~150-175 m² (estimated)

**Design Rationale:**

The clinical-only accommodation model follows international exemplars (Royal Free Hospital London, hVivo):
- Each room is self-contained; participants remain isolated for entire quarantine period
- **No communal areas** (kitchen, lounge, recreation) are included—this would compromise infection control
- Meals are delivered to rooms; staff enter through airlock in full PPE
- Entertainment and communication are provided via in-room systems
- 24/7 nursing coverage with continuous telemetry monitoring

## 2. Siting Strategy

### 2.1 Preferred Location: Li Ka Shing Centre for Health Research Innovation

The Challenge Unit is proposed for co-location with the Li Ka Shing Applied Virology Institute, enabling direct integration with Dr. Michael Houghton's hepatitis C vaccine program. The Li Ka Shing Centre provides foundational infrastructure:

| Factor | Li Ka Shing Centre Assessment |
|-------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| **Virology Institute proximity** | Same building as Dr. Houghton's laboratory |
| **Existing BSL capability** | BSL-2 and BSL-3 containment laboratories operational |
| **Air handling infrastructure** | Building designed for containment; adaptable |
| **Hospital proximity** | 240m to UAH; adequate for emergency response |
| **Decision authority** | University of Alberta Facilities & Operations |
| **cGMP adjacency** | ACTM cell manufacturing on 7th-8th floors |

### 2.2 Alternative Location: Kipnes Health Research Academy

Kipnes Health Research Academy may be an alternative site, but requires exploration.

### 2.3 Siting Comparison

| Criterion | Li Ka Shing Centre | Kipnes Academy | Adult CIU (UAH) |
|----------------------|-----------------|-----------------|-----------------|
| Virology alignment | Excellent | Poor | Poor |
| BSL infrastructure | Existing | Poor | Limited |
| Isolation room design | Renovation | Renovation | Unsuitable |
| Hospital emergency access | Reasonably close | Reasonably close | Immediate |
| Space allocation | Subject to approval | Subject to approval | Not available |

**Why Not the Existing Adult CIU?**

The NACTRC Adult CIU at UAH MacKenzie Centre is unsuitable for challenge trials due to:
- 4-bed ward configuration (not single-occupancy isolation rooms with en-suite)
- No negative pressure capability
- Extended quarantine (14+ days) incompatible with day-procedure design
- Major HVAC retrofit would be required

International comparators (Royal Free Hospital London, hVivo Canary Wharf) use purpose-designed containment facilities, not adapted clinical units.

## 3. Risk Analysis

### 3.1 Space Allocation Dependency

The Challenge Unit ($590,000) requires dedicated space with negative pressure isolation capability. Space allocation is subject to University of Alberta Facilities approval.

| Risk Element | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|--------------------|------------|------------|----------------------------|
| Space availability at Li Ka Shing | Medium | High | Early engagement with Virology Institute leadership |
| Approval timeline extending beyond RTA | Medium | High | Identify alternative locations (Kipnes) |
| Renovation costs exceeding budget | Low | Medium | Contingency in fit-out allocation |
| Governance complexity | Medium | Medium | Clear MOU with Virology Institute |

### 3.2 Risk Mitigation Strategies

1. **Modular Presentation**: Challenge Unit presented as distinct component with independent justification
2. **Contingent Budget**: Budget allocated as contingent pending space confirmation
3. **Early Engagement**: Initiate discussions with Li Ka Shing Institute leadership and University Facilities
4. **Phased Approach**: Challenge Unit as Phase 2 if space not confirmed for Phase 1
5. **Alternative Funding**: Identify complementary funding (Virology Institute, Government of Alberta pandemic preparedness)

### 3.3 Contingency Statement

> The Vaccine Challenge Trial Unit requires dedicated space with negative pressure isolation capability. The preferred location is the Li Ka Shing Centre for Health Research Innovation, co-located with the Li Ka Shing Applied Virology Institute. Space allocation is subject to University approval. If suitable space is not available, the Challenge Unit budget may be reallocated to other CTAP components or deferred to a subsequent funding phase.

## 4. What are Human Challenge Trials?

Human challenge trials (also called Controlled Human Infection Models - CHIMs) deliberately expose healthy volunteers to pathogens under controlled conditions to accelerate vaccine and therapeutic development. Key advantages include:

- **Accelerated efficacy signals**: 10-100x faster than traditional field trials
- **Smaller participant numbers**: Tens of participants vs. thousands
- **Mechanistic insights**: Precise understanding of infection dynamics and immune responses
- **Pandemic preparedness**: Rapid evaluation of candidate vaccines and therapeutics

Challenge trials have been instrumental in developing vaccines for influenza, malaria, typhoid, cholera, and most recently COVID-19. The UK's COVID-19 human challenge study (2021) at Imperial College London was the world's first for SARS-CoV-2.

---

## 6. Regulatory Pathway

**Health Canada:**
- No specific CHIM guidance currently exists
- Standard Clinical Trial Application (CTA) process applies under [Food and Drug Regulations Part C, Division 5](https://www.canada.ca/en/health-canada/services/drugs-health-products/drug-products/applications-submissions/guidance-documents/clinical-trials/clinical-trial-sponsors-applications.html)
- Pre-submission meeting recommended for novel challenge protocols
- 30-day authorization period for CTA review

**International Standards:**
- [WHO Guidance: Human challenge trials for vaccine development (TRS 1004, Annex 10)](https://www.who.int/publications/m/item/human-challenge-trials-for-vaccine-a10-trs-no-1004)
- ICH E6(R2) Good Clinical Practice
- Declaration of Helsinki ethical requirements
- Special ethics review for controlled infection studies

**Canada's Current Gap:** Canada has NO dedicated challenge trial facilities. CTAP would establish the first academic capability, positioning Alberta and Canada as leaders in accelerated vaccine development.

- Phase I safety evaluation with controlled HCV exposure
- Immune response characterization with precise infection timing
- Accelerated pathway to Phase II/III field trials

---

## 8. PRAIRIE Hub Vaccine Programs as Challenge Trial Unit Feeders

The Challenge Trial Unit completes Alberta's integrated vaccine development pipeline by providing clinical validation for two major PRAIRIE Hub sub-programs funded through the Canadian Biomanufacturing and Research Fund (CBRF/BRIF):

### 8.1 Sub-Program 1: Self-Amplifying RNA Vaccine Platform ($35.3M, Houghton)

**Scientific Lead:** Dr. Michael Houghton (Nobel laureate 2020), Director, Li Ka Shing Applied Virology Institute

This program develops **self-amplifying RNA (saRNA)** vaccines—an evolution of mRNA technology with significant manufacturing and deployment advantages:

| Feature | saRNA Advantage | Challenge Trial Relevance |
|------------------|---------------------|---------------------------------|
| **Dose** | ~10× lower than conventional mRNA | Smaller challenge cohorts needed for efficacy signal |
| **Manufacturing yield** | Dramatically higher doses per batch | Faster scale-up after Challenge Unit validation |
| **Reactogenicity** | Potentially fewer side effects | Improved safety profile for healthy volunteer challenges |
| **Global scalability** | Easier rapid deployment | Pandemic surge capacity through CMPC |

**Target Pathogens (High Pandemic Potential):**

| Pathogen Class | Vaccine Platform | CTAP Challenge Potential |
|-----------------|-----------------|--------------------------------------|
| **Influenza (H5N1)** | saRNA | WHO-approved CHIM models; attenuated strain challenges |
| **Orthopoxviruses** | saRNA | Modified vaccinia Ankara challenge; established protocols |
| **Arenaviruses** | saRNA | Research-stage models; biosafety level dependent |
| **Hepatitis C** | Recombinant protein | World's first HCV CHIM (Nobel-enabled discovery) |

**Explicit API Partnership:** Applied Pharmaceutical Innovation is a named industry partner in the Houghton program, linking saRNA process development directly to GMP translation and CMPC manufacturing.

### 8.2 Sub-Program 2: Comparative Vaccine Platform Program ($57M, Shmulevitz/Pelka)

**Scientific Leads:**
- Dr. Maya Shmulevitz (Canada Research Chair in Molecular Virology and Oncology, U of A)
- Dr. Peter Pelka (University of Manitoba)

This program systematically compares vaccine delivery platforms to determine optimal approaches for different pathogen classes and populations:

| Platform Under Evaluation | Challenge Trial Application |
|------------------------------------------|------------------------------|
| **Live attenuated virus** | Measles-like CHIM protocols |
| **Viral vectors** (adenovirus-based) | Established COVID-19 challenge experience |
| **Whole inactivated virus** | Influenza CHIM models |
| **Recombinant protein** | HCV challenge (Houghton program synergy) |
| **Alternative delivery routes** (intranasal, inhaled) | Mucosal immunity assessment via CHIM |

**Strategic Differentiators:**
1. **Head-to-head platform comparison** informs which candidates advance to Challenge Unit
2. **Advanced immune profiling** (mucosal vs systemic, durability, immunocompromised populations)
3. **Manufacturability lens**: Which platforms scale fastest? Which are most robust to supply-chain disruption?

**Challenge Unit Value:** The Shmulevitz program functions as a **national decision-support engine** for vaccine platform investment—de-risking Challenge Unit protocol selection and downstream CMPC manufacturing scale-up.

```

**Why Challenge Trials Accelerate Both Programs:**
- **Houghton saRNA Program**: Challenge trials provide efficacy signals 10-100× faster than field trials, enabling rapid iteration on saRNA formulations
- **Shmulevitz Comparative Program**: Head-to-head CHIM studies directly compare platform immunogenicity with precise infection timing—data impossible to obtain from field trials

**Manufacturing Lot Tracking:**

For PRAIRIE Hub vaccine candidates manufactured at ACTM and tested in the Challenge Trial Unit:
- Manufacturing batch numbers link to CTAP IP Pharmacy dispensing records
- Challenge dose timing and immune response data flow to Suite 4's OMOP manufacturing extension
- Batch-to-efficacy correlations inform CMPC scale-up manufacturing parameters

**Pandemic Preparedness Value:**

This integrated pathway—unique in Canada—enables rapid vaccine evaluation: when a novel pathogen emerges, PRAIRIE Hub can develop candidates (saRNA or optimal platform from Shmulevitz program), ACTM can manufacture clinical lots, and CTAP can provide efficacy signals through CHIM studies within months rather than years. The 70 million dose annual capacity at CMPC then enables population-scale production.

**Alberta's Strategic Position:** Together, the Houghton and Shmulevitz programs position Alberta as **Canada's vaccine engine**, with CTAP's Challenge Trial Unit providing the critical clinical validation capability that connects upstream discovery to downstream manufacturing.
