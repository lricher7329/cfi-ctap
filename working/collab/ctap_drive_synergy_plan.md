# CTAP-DRIVE Synergy and Coordination Plan

**Version:** 1.0
**Date:** 2025-12-29
**Status:** Draft for Discussion

---

## Executive Summary

The Clinical Trials Acceleration Platform (CTAP) and the CVRI Drug Research, Innovation, Validation & Evaluation (DRIVE) facility represent a **coordinated institutional strategy** to create end-to-end translational research capability at the University of Alberta. Rather than competing for resources, these proposals occupy **complementary positions in the drug development pipeline**:

- **DRIVE** fills upstream gaps: drug discovery, chemical synthesis, preclinical validation, and population phenotyping
- **CTAP** fills downstream gaps: clinical trials infrastructure, regulatory compliance, AI-augmented trial management, and decentralized access

**Key Finding:** After detailed analysis, **no equipment removal is recommended from either proposal**. The platforms share no overlapping equipment and serve distinct purposes. Together, they position the University of Alberta as **Canada's only institution with end-to-end AI-augmented bench-to-bedside capability**.

## Synergy Opportunities

### 1. Sequential Drug Translation Pathway

DRIVE-validated therapeutic candidates flow directly into CTAP clinical trials:

| Stage | Facility | Activities |
|-------|----------|------------|
| **1. Discovery** | DRIVE DDSU | AI target identification, chemical synthesis |
| **2. Preclinical** | DRIVE CAPU | PK/PD, toxicology, efficacy in disease models |
| **3. Population** | DRIVE CHPU | Multi-OMICs profiling, biomarker identification |
| **4. Phase I** | CTAP Suite 1 | First-in-human trials, dose escalation |
| **5. Biobanking** | CTAP Suite 2 | Trial specimen storage, EMR linkage |
| **6. Mechanistic** | CTAP Suite 3 | Spatial/functional assays, cryo-EM validation |
| **7. Regulatory** | CTAP Suite 4 | CDISC transformation, Health Canada submission |
| **8. Expansion** | CTAP Suite 5 | Decentralized trials, underserved populations |

### 2. Co-Clinical Trial Capability

DRIVE explicitly identifies "co-clinical trials" (simultaneous animal + human testing) as a key capability. This requires both platforms:

- **Animal Arm:** DRIVE CAPU runs parallel rodent studies
- **Human Arm:** CTAP Suite 1 runs Phase I/II trials
- **Data Integration:** CTAP Suite 4 TRE harmonizes both arms
- **Specimen Correlation:** DRIVE CHPU + CTAP Suite 3 enable molecular comparison

### 3. Shared Disease Programs

Both proposals support overlapping disease areas:

| Disease Area | DRIVE Contribution | CTAP Contribution |
|--------------|-------------------|-------------------|
| **Cardiovascular** | Alberta HEART Study, drug candidates | CVM flagship, pragmatic trials |
| **Aging/Longevity** | Alberta Longevity Project, anti-aging drugs | Biospecimen-outcome linkage |
| **Diabetes** | Drug development (SGLT2-like) | Connect1d integration, wearables |
| **Cancer** | Drug discovery, metabolic targets | Radiomics/imaging AI |
| **Stroke** | Population phenotyping | Clinical validation |

### 4. Shared Equipment Access

| Equipment | Host | Partner Access |
|-----------|------|----------------|
| NovaSeq X Plus | DRIVE CHPU | CTAP trial samples at core rates |
| ACTM GMP Manufacturing | CTAP Suite 2 | DRIVE therapeutic candidates |
| TRE/Secure Computing | CTAP Suite 4 | DRIVE omics data integration |
| Living Biorepository | CTAP Suite 2 | DRIVE population study samples |
| Spatial Transcriptomics | CTAP Suite 3 | DRIVE validation studies |

---

## Cross-Proposal Language

### For CTAP RTA (Section 4 - Research Supported)

> **Strategic Alignment with CVRI DRIVE**
>
> CTAP is designed as the clinical translation partner to the CVRI DRIVE proposal, creating an integrated discovery-to-patient pathway. While DRIVE addresses upstream gaps in drug design, synthesis, and preclinical validation, CTAP provides the downstream clinical trials infrastructure. This complementary positioning creates unique institutional capability:
>
> - DRIVE's Drug Discovery and Synthesis Unit identifies therapeutic candidates
> - DRIVE's Comprehensive Animal Phenotyping Unit validates preclinical efficacy/safety
> - DRIVE's Comprehensive Human Phenotyping Unit characterizes target populations
> - **CTAP Suite 1** conducts first-in-human and Phase II trials
> - **CTAP Suite 2** banks specimens for mechanistic substudies
> - **CTAP Suite 3** integrates omics with clinical outcomes
> - **CTAP Suite 4** manages regulatory submissions and AI-augmented analysis
> - **CTAP Suite 5** extends trials to underserved populations
>
> Together, DRIVE and CTAP position the University of Alberta as Canada's only institution with end-to-end AI-augmented bench-to-bedside capability.

### For CTAP Suite 3 Narrative

> For genomic, transcriptomic, and epigenomic characterization, trial specimens access the CVRI DRIVE Comprehensive Human Phenotyping Unit's Illumina NovaSeq X Plus sequencer via established core facility agreements. This arrangement avoids equipment duplication while ensuring CTAP trials benefit from high-throughput sequencing capacity. CTAP's Suite 3 focuses on complementary capabilities: spatial transcriptomics (Xenium), functional proteomics (IsoLight), and metabolomics/glycomics - modalities not available through DRIVE.

### For DRIVE RTA (Suggested)

> DRIVE provides the upstream drug discovery and preclinical validation infrastructure that feeds directly into clinical trials conducted through CFI CTAP's AI-native clinical trials platform, creating an integrated discovery-to-patient pathway. Therapeutic candidates validated in DRIVE's Comprehensive Animal Phenotyping Unit can proceed directly to first-in-human trials via CTAP's clinical infrastructure, with coordinated biospecimen handling through CTAP's Living Biorepository and molecular characterization through both platforms' complementary omics capabilities.

### For CFI Reviewers (If Asked About Coordination)

> "DRIVE and CTAP represent a coordinated institutional strategy to create end-to-end translational capability. DRIVE fills upstream gaps (drug discovery, preclinical validation, population phenotyping) while CTAP fills downstream gaps (clinical trials, regulatory compliance, decentralized access). The platforms share no equipment and serve complementary pipeline positions. A joint governance structure and MOU will ensure efficient handoff of therapeutic candidates from DRIVE preclinical validation to CTAP clinical trials."
