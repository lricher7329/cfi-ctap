## Summary

DRIVE is a proposed CVRI/FoMD core facility focused on drug design/synthesis and animal/human phenotyping. DRIVE will integrate existing CVRI facilities with newly created "first in Canada" research units and partner with other U of A core facilities to create a much-needed novel platform of translational research, filling an institutional and national gap in drug development and translational research.

DRIVE will allow drugs, along with companion biomarkers, to be discovered through *in silico* modeling through artificial intelligence (AI)-enabled drug discovery pipelines, chemically synthesized, and validated using cutting-edge animal and human tissues phenotyping units, with the ultimate goal of advancing them to early-phase clinical trials.

**Key Features:**

- First of its kind in Canada
- Open to all investigators from the U of A, as well as from Canadian and international universities and industry
- Will accelerate the U of A research progress in identifying drug targets (e.g., new cryo-EM unit), AI and clinical trials (NACTC, SPORE)
- Positions the U of A as a national leader in translational research and accelerated drug development

**Research Focus Areas:**

- Cardiovascular/stroke
- Aging
- Obesity
- Diabetes
- Cancer research

DRIVE will evolve towards a financially self-sustainable core and eventually, through partnership with other academic and industry leaders, to a profitable national hub of drug development and translational research.

## Institutional Need

### A) Drug Design and Synthesis Gap

There is no comprehensive drug design and synthesis core facility at the U of A or anywhere in Canada. Discovery of novel drugs and their companion biomarkers is the cornerstone of innovation in medical research, and this gap significantly compromises academic translational research and opportunities for spin-off companies. Pharmaceutical companies increasingly rely on academic centers that have the ability to design, evaluate and validate new drugs.

### B) Human Phenotyping Gap

Comprehensive human phenotyping is not available at the U of A and is publicly available in very few sites in Canada, mainly in BC and Quebec. An increasing number of academia or industry-driven clinical trials now require genetic and molecular phenotyping of their subjects through OMICs studies to select best optimal candidates (precision medicine). Centers that can do that have a much higher chance to be the drivers of such large international studies.

### C) Animal Phenotyping Gap

The U of A lacks an integrated comprehensive animal phenotyping core. These are now more critical than ever for drug development and translational research. This is because, in contrast to the past, the impact of a drug in multiple organs (over and above its primary target and disease) is required prior to approval, to predict adverse effects. In addition, the complete phenotype of transgenic animals is required prior to their utilization in drug validation. This requires cores that can evaluate multiple parameters in a treated or transgenic animal, including cardiovascular, CNS, liver, kidneys, bone marrow and metabolism.

**DRIVE will fill these 3 critical gaps.**

## Components of DRIVE

### I. Drug Discovery and Synthesis Unit (DDSU)

Proprietary and existing AI platforms will be applied to identify drugs that target critical disease-modifying proteins, also using AI-enhanced robotic surface plasmon resonance (SPR) high-throughput screening (HTS) and molecular modeling.

**Workflow:**

1. Screening of both small-molecule libraries and AI-generated analogs that mimic naturally occurring ligands
2. Drugs synthesized chemically in house at purity adequate for biological experiments
3. Binding profiles/sites and predicted mechanisms of action identified *in silico* to guide molecular and in vivo validation experiments in the animal phenotyping unit

**Leadership:**

- **Director:** Dr. Tabatabaei (drug design expert, junior faculty from FoPPS)
- **Team:** Dr. Zhao (medicinal chemist, Dept of Medicine)
- Additional expertise in structural biology will be sought as the program grows

**Track Record:** Over the past 3 years, the DDSU has designed 3 novel small molecules that show promising cardiovascular, cancer, diabetes and anti-ageing benefits and are currently being validated by several CVRI members.

**Partnership:** In partnership with the Drug Development & Innovation Centre (DDIC) core of the FoPPS, formulation, delivery modes, pharmacokinetics and regulatory support will also be established.

**Space:** Available within the CVRI, which recently integrated with the CVRC.

---

### II. Comprehensive Animal Phenotyping Unit (CAPU)

Drugs synthesized in the DDSU will be tested and validated at the cellular and animal level in the CAPU, essentially a small animal hospital.

**Existing Equipment (from prior CFI awards):**

- Rodent PET/MRI
- Echocardiography/vascular ultrasound
- Metabolic chambers
- Body composition assessment unit
- Rodent catheterization and surgery
- Telemetry
- Exercise treadmills
- Blood chemistry point-of-care
- Cognitive/memory assessment units

**Capabilities:**

- Assess the full impact of drugs
- Full phenotype of relevant transgenic animals in several diseases
- Collaboration with the U of A transgenic core facility
- Equipment for FoMD transgenic core to ensure all knockout and transgenic animals can be cryopreserved following phenotyping
- Critical for ageing research where multiple organs and functional states need to be assessed simultaneously over time

**Leadership:**

- **Directors:** Dr. Dyck (Pediatrics) and Dr. Ussher (FoPPS)
- **CVRI Scientists (many CRCs):** Drs. Sutendra, Michelakis, Oudit, Kassiri, Jickling, Freed, Nagendran
- Additional team members from several faculties, departments and institutes bringing expertise in cancer, nutrition, stroke, transplantation, cardiac surgery, liver and kidney disease

---

### III. Comprehensive Human Phenotyping Unit (CHPU)

The U of A has many strengths in clinical and outcomes research (e.g., NACTRC, SPORE, a unique province-wide electronic medical record) but has not reached its potential as it lacks a core for high throughput OMICS in human blood/tissues (genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, epigenomics from the same patient).

**Purpose:**

- Essential for most academic and industry trials that assess drugs and biomarkers
- Simultaneous assessment with multi-OMICS essential for eventual approval of drugs and their companion biomarkers, as well as for mechanistic understanding
- Will allow the U of A to assume a leadership role in clinical trials at the national and international level
- Essential for ageing/longevity research

**Key Projects Supported:**

- **Alberta Ageing Project (ALP):** Large longevity study of 10,000 subjects led by Dr. Michelakis
- **Alberta HEART Study:** Province-wide clinical heart failure program led by Dr. Dyck
- **Province-wide stroke studies:** Led by Dr. Jickling
- Cancer, transplantation and diabetes trials at U of A

**Leadership:**

- **Directors:** Drs. Michelakis and Sutendra (clinician scientist and basic researcher with published expertise in mechanistic early-phase trials in CV disease and cancer)

## Research Supported by DRIVE

DRIVE will support any novel drug for any disease, but priorities include:

### a) Ageing/Longevity Research

A global priority that is also the top priority for the CVRI, the Dept of Medicine, and an emerging priority at the CHS and AHS. Ageing and longevity research involves all organs and biology systems and is one of the fields that needs DRIVE the most, since there is an explosion of need for anti-ageing drugs and longevity research.

### b) Cardiovascular Disease

Including heart failure and acute coronary syndromes, the focus of most CVRI members and many other faculty in several departments and institutes. A recognized strength of the FoMD both at the basic science and clinical research and outcomes research. The strengths of the U of A in clinical CV disease fields (NACTRC, provincial electronic medical record, VIGOUR, SPORE) will elevate to a level of international leadership if the clinical trials/outcomes research is supplemented by novel drugs and multi-OMICs profiles of Alberta patients.

**Vision:** Databases of molecularly phenotyped patients merged with their clinical phenotype drawn by the EMR and the SPORE unit. Such comprehensive databases will be unique and highly sought after by academia and industry outside the U of A.

### c) Ischemia-Reperfusion (IR) Injury

Compromises the use of most offered solid organs for transplantation (hearts, lungs, livers, kidneys). The U of A is one of the largest transplant centers in the world (lungs, hearts, islets, kidney, liver). Some drugs already synthesized by the DDSU team (e.g., SNAP) inhibit IR injury in normal organs and can be directly translated in clinical trials where CVRI transplant clinician scientists (e.g., Drs. Freed, Nagendran) conduct pioneering work in heart and lung transplants.

**Partnership:** Established between CVRI and ATI; many anti-IR injury drugs developed by DRIVE for CV disease will have applications in transplant medicine.

### d) Stroke Research

A recognized strength of the U of A. Several clinician scientists like Dr. Jickling run provincial networks of stroke outcomes with a great need to link them with multi-OMICs data. The CHPU will be of significant help to Dr. Jickling, who was recently awarded a large Genome Canada grant to phenotype stroke patients at the population level.

### e) Diabetes

An established strength of the U of A. Novel diabetes drugs are prime examples of drugs developed for one disease, but during clinical trials it became apparent that they have unexpected benefits for seemingly unrelated diseases like dementia or even ageing (e.g., metformin, Ozempic, SGLT2 inhibitors). All 3 drugs developed by the DDSU have anti-diabetes effects and the PIs that developed them (Dyck, Ussher, Sutendra, Michelakis) are CVRI members with expertise in both metabolism and CV disease.

### f) Cancer

CVRI members that developed novel drugs through the DDSU also have strong presence in the cancer field (Michelakis, Sutendra, Dyck). Remarkably, these drugs, in addition to longevity and diabetes, have anti-cancer benefits (like metformin). Cancer scientists will benefit from DRIVE tremendously.

**Co-clinical Trials:** One of the most exciting developments in translational cancer research is the conduction of co-clinical trials, where a drug is tested in real time simultaneously in animals and patients. Only a unit like DRIVE will offer U of A scientists the ability to conduct them.

## Operational Components of DRIVE

### Governance

A steering committee (clinical/basic researchers, administrators) will be set to:

- Prioritize the drugs tested in DRIVE, from CVRI and other institutes
- Oversee DRIVE's vision and expansion
- Members from U of A spin-off companies will be added in time

### Business Model

- Business plan established in terms of fees paid to DRIVE from U of A investigators or out-of-U of A academics and industries
- All contracts including IP issues approved by the U of A legal department
- Financial supervision under the Dean's office of the FoMD
- Beyond cost recovery, profits reinvested in DRIVE to cover repairs and hiring additional HQPs

### Visibility and Training

- Featured in the CVRI and FoMD core facilities web sites
- Supplemented by a graduate training program in Translational Medicine (currently under the Dept of Medicine, to be expanded into the CVRI)
- Robust program of visiting professors sponsored by the CVRI and the Dept of Medicine in partnership with other institutes

**Diagram Description:** A summary vision of the flow of knowledge within DRIVE's components: Disease targets will be identified in the CHPU. Drugs for these targets will be designed and synthesized in the DDSU and then validated and developed in animal disease models in the CAPU. These targets can also lead to generation of transgenic mice that would also be comprehensively phenotyped in the CAPU.
