## Canada's First Integrated Drug Discovery-to-Validation Platform

**A CVRI/FoMD Core Facility**

**Version:** 2.0 (Enhanced)
**Date:** 2025-12-30

---

## Executive Summary

DRIVE is Canada's first comprehensive drug discovery-to-validation platform, integrating AI-enabled drug design, chemical synthesis, and multi-scale phenotyping (animal and human) within a single translational infrastructure. Located at the University of Alberta's Cardiovascular Research Institute (CVRI), DRIVE fills three critical national gaps: (1) comprehensive drug design and synthesis capability, (2) integrated animal phenotyping, and (3) high-throughput human multi-omics phenotyping.

**Total Request:** ~$10,346,000

**Strategic Positioning:** DRIVE operates at the upstream end of the translational pipeline—discovering therapeutic candidates, validating them preclinically, and characterizing target populations—with a clear handoff pathway to clinical trials infrastructure. When combined with downstream clinical trials capability (e.g., CTAP, NACTRC), DRIVE positions the University of Alberta as Canada's only institution with **end-to-end bench-to-bedside capability**.

**Key Differentiators:**
- **First comprehensive drug design and synthesis core in Canada**
- **18,000 compound-target interactions per day** via ECHO + SPR 64 system
- **Multi-omics from the same sample** capability for human phenotyping
- **Co-clinical trial capability** (simultaneous animal and human drug testing)
- **Integration with provincial electronic medical record** (Connect Care, 4.4M patients)
- **AI-augmented drug discovery** leveraging Amii expertise

## 2. The Opportunity

### 2.1 National Gaps

**Gap A: Drug Design and Synthesis**

There is no comprehensive drug design and synthesis core facility at the U of A or anywhere in Canada. Discovery of novel drugs and their companion biomarkers is the cornerstone of innovation in medical research, and this gap significantly compromises academic translational research and opportunities for spin-off companies. Pharmaceutical companies increasingly rely on academic centres that have the ability to design, evaluate, and validate new drugs.

**Gap B: Integrated Human Phenotyping**

Comprehensive human phenotyping is not available at the U of A and is publicly available in very few sites in Canada, mainly in BC and Quebec. An increasing number of academia- or industry-driven clinical trials now require genetic and molecular phenotyping of their subjects through OMICs studies to select best optimal candidates (precision medicine). Centres that can do this have a much higher chance to be the drivers of such large international studies.

**Gap C: Comprehensive Animal Phenotyping**

The U of A lacks an integrated comprehensive animal phenotyping core. These are now more critical than ever for drug development and translational research. In contrast to the past, the impact of a drug in multiple organs (over and above its primary target and disease) is required prior to approval, to predict adverse effects. In addition, the complete phenotype of transgenic animals is required prior to their utilization in drug validation.

**DRIVE will fill all three gaps**, creating Canada's first comprehensive drug discovery-to-validation platform.

### 2.2 Why the University of Alberta, Why Now

Alberta possesses a convergence of advantages that cannot be easily replicated:

**Unrivalled AI Capacity.** The Alberta Machine Intelligence Institute (Amii), with over 10 CIFAR AI Chairs focused on health and life sciences and leadership that includes pioneers of modern reinforcement learning, provides in-house expertise to deploy AI directly into drug discovery workflows—molecular modelling, target identification, binding prediction, and QSAR analysis.

**A Unified Health System.** Alberta's single-payer system, underpinned by Connect Care—a province-wide Epic-based clinical information system spanning 682 sites and serving 4.4 million Albertans—provides computable access to longitudinal records for population-scale phenotyping. DRIVE's CHPU can query this dataset to identify patient cohorts for phenotyping and biomarker discovery.

**Mature Discovery Infrastructure.** The Alberta Cryo-EM Facility (the only one in Alberta, one of five in Canada), Glycomics Institute of Alberta (GIA), The Metabolomics Innovation Centre (TMIC), and Alberta Proteomics and Mass Spectrometry (APM) provide world-class structural and molecular characterization capabilities that DRIVE can leverage for structure-guided drug design.

**Expanding Biomanufacturing Capacity.** The Drug Development & Innovation Centre (DDIC), Alberta Cell Therapy Manufacturing (ACTM), and the under-construction Critical Medicines Production Centre (CMPC, $200M, 70M+ doses/year by 2026) provide pathways from DRIVE-validated candidates to clinical-grade manufacturing.

**Downstream Clinical Trials Infrastructure.** The Clinical Trials Acceleration Platform (CTAP), Northern Alberta Clinical Trials and Research Centre (NACTRC), Canadian VIGOUR Centre (CVC), and SPOR SUPPORT Unit provide the clinical trials infrastructure needed to translate DRIVE discoveries into human validation—completing the bench-to-bedside pathway.

## 4. Research Supported by DRIVE

DRIVE will support any novel drug for any disease, but priorities include six key areas that leverage institutional strengths and address unmet medical needs:

### 4.1 Ageing/Longevity Research

A global priority that is the top priority for the CVRI, the Dept of Medicine, and an emerging priority at the CHS and AHS. Ageing and longevity research involves all organs and biology systems and is one of the fields that needs DRIVE the most, since there is an explosion of need for anti-ageing drugs.

**DRIVE Contribution:**
- DDSU synthesis of anti-ageing drug candidates
- CAPU comprehensive multi-organ assessment of ageing phenotypes
- CHPU epigenomic DNAm clocks linked to clinical outcomes

**Key Program:** Alberta Ageing/Longevity Project (10,000 subjects) will leverage all three DRIVE units for population-scale phenotyping and drug target identification.

### 4.2 Cardiovascular Disease

Including heart failure and acute coronary syndromes, the focus of most CVRI members. A recognized strength of the FoMD both at the basic science and clinical research levels.

**DRIVE Contribution:**
- Novel cardiovascular drug candidates (3 currently in pipeline)
- Telemetry and catheterization for cardiac efficacy/safety
- Multi-omics profiles linked to NACTRC, VIGOUR, SPORE outcomes

**Vision:** Databases of molecularly phenotyped patients merged with clinical phenotypes from Connect Care and the SPOR SUPPORT Unit. Such comprehensive databases will be unique and highly sought after by academia and industry.

### 4.3 Ischemia-Reperfusion (IR) Injury

Compromises the use of most offered solid organs for transplantation. The U of A is one of the largest transplant centres in the world (lungs, hearts, islets, kidney, liver).

**DRIVE Contribution:**
- SNAP and related compounds inhibit IR injury
- CAPU validation in ex vivo perfusion models
- Partnership with Alberta Transplant Institute (ATI)

**Translation Pathway:** DRIVE-validated IR injury drugs → DDIC formulation → clinical trials with CVRI transplant clinician scientists (Drs. Freed, Nagendran).

### 4.4 Stroke Research

A recognized strength of the U of A. Dr. Jickling's recent Genome Canada award for population-level stroke phenotyping creates natural synergy with CHPU.

**DRIVE Contribution:**
- CHPU multi-omics linked to stroke outcomes
- Drug candidates targeting stroke pathophysiology
- Integration with provincial stroke outcome networks

### 4.5 Diabetes

An established strength of the U of A. Novel diabetes drugs (metformin, Ozempic, SGLT2 inhibitors) have demonstrated unexpected benefits for seemingly unrelated diseases—all 3 DDSU drugs have anti-diabetes effects.

**DRIVE Contribution:**
- Drug candidates with metabolic benefits
- CAPU metabolic chambers and glucose tolerance assessment
- Integration with Alberta Diabetes Institute

**Translation Pathway:** DRIVE-validated metabolic drugs → clinical trials via ADI Clinical Research Unit → potential Connect1d registry integration.

### 4.6 Cancer

CVRI members with drug development expertise (Michelakis, Sutendra, Dyck) have strong presence in the cancer field. DRIVE drugs, in addition to longevity and diabetes benefits, have anti-cancer properties.

**DRIVE Contribution:**
- Novel anti-cancer drug candidates
- Optical imaging for tumour tracking in CAPU
- Multi-omics for biomarker discovery

**Co-Clinical Trials:** One of the most exciting developments in translational cancer research is the conduction of co-clinical trials, where a drug is tested in real time simultaneously in animals and patients. Only a unit like DRIVE—coordinated with downstream clinical trials infrastructure—can offer U of A scientists this capability.

## 15. Conclusion

DRIVE fills three critical gaps in Canada's translational research infrastructure: drug design and synthesis, comprehensive animal phenotyping, and high-throughput human multi-omics. By integrating AI-enabled drug discovery, multi-scale validation, and population phenotyping within a single platform, DRIVE creates a unique capability that positions the University of Alberta as a national leader in translational research.

When combined with downstream clinical trials infrastructure (CTAP, NACTRC, DDIC, ACTM), DRIVE completes an end-to-end bench-to-bedside pathway—Canada's only institution with integrated capability from molecular target identification through clinical validation.

DRIVE will accelerate the translation of discoveries into human health benefits, attract industry partnerships, generate spin-off opportunities, and train the next generation of translational researchers. This is not incremental improvement—it is a transformational investment in Canada's drug development capacity.
