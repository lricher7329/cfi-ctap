This is directly relevant to your CTAP work. Let me search for current evidence on clinical trial barriers across these jurisdictions.Based on current evidence, there are some striking commonalities across Canada, the UK, and Australia, alongside jurisdiction-specific challenges. This synthesis should be useful for framing the CTAP value proposition.

## Common Cross-Jurisdictional Barriers

**Study Startup Time** emerges as the dominant barrier across all three countries. The average startup time for a clinical trial in Canada can stretch to 35 weeks, significantly longer than other jurisdictions. Academic medical centres and hospitals show median trial activation times of 9.4 months from site selection to contract completion. The UK has been addressing this—approval times were cut from 91 days to 41 days between September 2023 and August 2024 through AI tools and risk-proportionate review processes.

**Fragmented Ethics Review** is particularly problematic for multi-centre trials. In Canada, a trial approved in one province or centre must undergo separate approvals in others, placing the country at a competitive disadvantage internationally. Sequential submission to ethics committees and regulatory agencies within and across countries results in unwarranted delays in obtaining final approval to enrol participants.

**Contract and Budget Negotiations** represent a major delay driver. Negotiating and getting a site contract signed can take a considerable amount of time. The most frequent reason identified before ethics submission was negotiating excess treatment costs, which contributed to delays in nearly half of sites.

**Workforce Capacity** is consistently cited. Insufficient stable funding to support trials infrastructure and retain staff was identified as a key barrier in Canada, with clinical trials units adopting strict cost-recovery policies leading to fewer academic trials. Unstable clinical trial funding and investment, lack of recognition for the trial workforce, and long and inconsistent approval processes affect both metropolitan and rural health services.

## Canada-Specific Gaps

Canada needs a national portfolio system for clinical trials that increases capacity for research and improves access for patients regardless of location. Through this approach, the UK was able to launch its historic RECOVERY trial with unprecedented speed during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Canada lags all G7 countries in time for patients to access approved new treatments—over two years on average, which is one year longer than many other developed countries. This creates a negative signal for trial sponsors considering Canadian sites.

Access to clinical trials often depends on proximity to health facilities, causing enrolment delays particularly challenging for marginalized communities, Indigenous Peoples, and people in rural and remote areas.

## UK-Specific Challenges

Despite recent progress, the UK still faces implementation challenges. The Study Set-Up Plan is being delivered to streamline and reform set-up through digitalisation and reducing unnecessary bureaucracy to meet the government's 150-day target for clinical trial study set-up.

£15.75 million was allocated through NIHR to implement national contracting processes for commercial clinical trials to address delays in multi-site studies. The fact that this required dedicated funding underscores how entrenched contracting delays had become.

## Australia-Specific Challenges

Australia maintains a competitive regulatory environment—the first patient into a clinical trial in Australia averages about three months after approvals, compared to six to nine months in the US or EU. However, there are significant structural issues:

The main barriers to conducting clinical trials in rural, regional and remote areas were lack of investment and engagement from health service executives, workforce limitations, inconsistent training, lack of physical infrastructure, and competing clinical priorities.

The complex regulatory environment for trials in Australia can act as a barrier for companies looking for efficient and cost-effective locations—despite having streamlined ethics processes at the national level, the federated state/territory system creates complexity.

In Australia, the challenges in delivering clinical trials in children is further compounded by distance, with less concentrated populations and large distances between capitals, and position outside major global regulators.

## Key Reform Priorities Emerging

WHO experts propose key actions including: leveraging existing trial networks and capacity-building initiatives; advancing joint and parallel regulatory and ethics reviews and single national ethics review; improving transparency on approval requirements; simplifying and standardising informed consent forms and processes; and developing mechanisms to improve efficiency for trial site contracting as well as importation of investigational products.

Six key drivers contribute to regulatory delays: disparate regulations, submission delays, additional requirements subsequent to regulatory approval, use of local ethics committees, infrequent ethics committee meetings, and regulatory backlogs.

The CTAP domains you've been developing—particularly the AI-enabled protocol optimization, coordinated multi-site infrastructure, and streamlined data flow components—directly address several of these persistent barriers. The UK's recent success with AI-assisted regulatory review provides useful precedent for what's achievable.
