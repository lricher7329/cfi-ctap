# **Clinical Trial Spending: Canada, United Kingdom, Australia**

## **Canada**

* **Total spending:**  No recent consolidated total is published.**  **Industry (pharmaceutical) spending on trials was historically around **C$646 million** (≈US$500M) in 2011 .**  **Government support (e.g. CIHR’s Clinical Trials Fund) was **C$163.1 million** in 2022–23 .**  **Combining these suggests Canadian clinical trial spending on the order of **~C$0.8–1.0 billion** (≈US$0.6–0.75B), but no exact 2022–23 figure is available in the sources.
* **Breakdown:**  Of the above, industry likely contributes the bulk (~80–85%) and government the rest.**  **For example, CIHR (the federal research agency) allocated C$163M to clinical trials projects in 2022–23 .**  **(CIHR overall health research funding is ~C$1+ billion annually , but only a fraction goes to trials.)**  **The remainder (~C$0.6–0.8B) would be industry-sponsored.
* **Per capita:**  Canada’s population is ~38 million.**  **If total trial spending is roughly C$0.8–1.0B, that implies **~C$20–26 per person** (≈US$15–20 per person).

## **United Kingdom**

* **Total spending:**  Industry and government together account for roughly **£2.45 billion** in 2022–23 (≈US$3.1B).**  **The National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) – the UK’s main public research funder – reported a spend of **£1.249 billion** in 2022/23 .**  **Separately, industry-funded trials generated about **£1.2 billion** of income to the NHS in 2022/23 .**  **(These sums overlap trial activity in the NHS – combining them suggests total trial-related spend ≈£2.45B.)
* **Breakdown:**  Public funding (NIHR and related UKRI grants) accounted for ~£1.25B , while private/industry trials contributed roughly £1.2B .**  **Thus about half of total trial funding was government-funded research, and half industry-sponsored.
* **Per capita:**  The UK population is ~67 million.**  **£2.45B total spending equates to about **£36 per person** (≈US$45 per person).

## **Australia**

* **Total spending:**  In 2022, Australia’s clinical trials sector spent about **A$1.6 billion** (≈US$1.1B) .**  **(This figure is from a June 2024 industry report.)
* **Breakdown:**  Industry (self-funded) trials accounted for the majority (~A$1.25B), while government and academic sources covered the rest.**  **In 2022 the federal government’s Medical Research Future Fund (MRFF) contributed **A$120M** and the NHMRC (another national agency) **A$80M** to clinical trials  .**  **Additional sources (state, university and philanthropic funds) added ~A$150M .**  **In sum, industry-sponsored trials provided roughly 78% of spending, and government/other bodies ~22%.
* **Per capita:**  With ~26 million people, A$1.6B corresponds to about **A$62 per person** (≈US$43 per person).
