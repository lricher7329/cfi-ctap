# Idea

I believe the challenge unit needs more research and planning with regard to the space needed and requirements. For example, if a 14-day quarantine is required, then facilities like toilets, showers, and a kitchen also need to included. An extended stay would require an entertainment/television area and sleeping quarters. Please review these additional requirements - confirming first that they are necessary based on other facilities. If so this idea will need to be integrated in suite 1.

## Research Questions - RESOLVED

1. **Quarantine duration**: What is the typical quarantine period for challenge trials?
   - **Answer**: Pathogen-dependent, typically 14+ days. Discharge requires PCR-negative confirmation.
   - **Source**: Idea 2025-12-24_004 (hVivo/Imperial College research)

2. **Living facilities**: What facilities are required for extended participant stays?
   - **Answer**: Clinical-only accommodation model is standard:
     - [x] Private sleeping quarters (single-occupancy required for infection control)
     - [x] En-suite bathroom (required - no shared facilities)
     - [x] In-room meal delivery (not communal dining)
     - [x] Entertainment (TV/WiFi/streaming)
     - [x] Communication (intercom to nursing station)
     - [x] Work surface (desk for extended stay comfort)
   - **Source**: Idea 2025-12-24_006 (Royal Free Hospital, hVivo analysis)

3. **Reference facilities**: What do existing challenge trial units include?
   - **hVivo (UK/Germany)**: 150+ beds, BSL-3 certified, world's largest commercial operator
   - **hVivo Canary Wharf**: 50-70 beds, purpose-built 2023, highest hospital isolation standards
   - **Imperial College London**: CL3 capable, led world's first COVID-19 challenge study
   - **Royal Free Hospital**: Secure containment specialist unit, COVID-19 challenge partner
   - **Canada**: NO dedicated facilities exist - CTAP would be first

## Research Findings

### International Facility Design Model

Based on research from ideas 2025-12-24_004, 2025-12-24_006, and 2025-12-24_007:

| Requirement | Specification | Notes |
|-------------|---------------|-------|
| **Room type** | Single-occupancy isolation | Required for infection control |
| **Pressure** | Negative -25 to -30 Pa | 10x CDC minimum |
| **Air changes** | ≥12 ACH with HEPA | Continuous monitoring |
| **Bathroom** | Private en-suite | Toilet, shower, sink |
| **Entry** | Airlock with interlocking doors | Prevent cross-contamination |
| **Monitoring** | 24/7 telemetry, video | Continuous vital signs |
| **Meals** | In-room delivery | Not communal |
| **Entertainment** | TV, WiFi, streaming | Extended stay comfort |

### Clinical-Only Accommodation Model (Selected)

The CTAP Challenge Unit will use a **clinical-only model** similar to Royal Free Hospital and hVivo:

- Each isolation room functions as a self-contained unit
- Participants remain in their room for the entire quarantine period
- **No communal areas** (kitchen, lounge, recreation) are required
- Meals delivered to room; staff enter through airlock in PPE
- Entertainment/communication via in-room systems

**Rationale**: Communal areas would compromise infection control. International exemplars do not include shared spaces for challenge trial participants.

### Space Requirements - CONFIRMED

Based on 14-day quarantine scenario (4 rooms planned):

| Area | Per Room | Total (4 rooms) | Status |
|------|----------|-----------------|--------|
| Sleeping/living area | ~15 m² | 60 m² | Included in fit-out |
| En-suite bathroom | ~5 m² | 20 m² | Included in fit-out |
| Airlock entry | ~3 m² | 12 m² | Included in fit-out |
| **Total participant space** | ~23 m² | ~92 m² | **Planned** |

Additional spaces (shared infrastructure):
- Nursing station: ~15 m²
- Pathogen preparation area: ~20 m² (BSL-2+)
- Staff PPE donning/doffing: ~10 m²
- Storage/utilities: ~15 m²

**Total Challenge Unit footprint**: ~150-175 m² (estimated)

## Budget Confirmation

Extended-stay amenities are **included within existing budget**:

| Equipment ID | Item | Cost | Includes |
|--------------|------|------|----------|
| 38 | Challenge Isolation Room Fit-Out | $300,000 | En-suite, airlock, bed, entertainment, work surface |
| 39 | HEPA Filtration System | $80,000 | Air handling for negative pressure |
| 40 | Continuous Monitoring Stations | $60,000 | Telemetry, intercom, video |
| 41 | Pathogen Preparation Area | $50,000 | BSL-2+ biosafety cabinet |
| **Total** | | **$490,000** | **Complete Challenge Unit** |

**No additional budget required** - extended-stay requirements are within existing $300K room fit-out allocation.

## Implementation Completed

- [x] Research questions answered from existing idea documentation
- [x] Clinical-only accommodation model confirmed
- [x] Space requirements documented
- [x] Budget confirmed as adequate
- [x] Section 2.5.3 added to Suite 1 document
- [x] Equipment description updated in Google Sheets

## Status: INCORPORATED

This idea has been researched and integrated into Suite 1 documentation.
