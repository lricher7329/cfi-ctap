# Idea

Clarify the status and details of the Pluripotent Stem Cell Core facility referenced in Suite 2.

## Context

In the Suite 2 brief (line 40), the Pluripotent Stem Cell Core is listed as "Planned" in the facility partners table. However:

1. The iPSC culture automation platform ($500,000) is included in the equipment budget
2. The technical spec (Section 3.2) describes the platform components
3. It's unclear if this is a new core facility being established or an expansion of existing capability

## Questions to Resolve

1. Is there an existing iPSC capability at UAlberta that this builds upon?
2. Who will lead this core facility?
3. What is the relationship to ACTM?
4. Should this be reframed as "ACTM iPSC Platform" rather than a separate core?

## Suggested Implementation

1. Research existing iPSC capabilities at UAlberta
2. Confirm with ACTM leadership about integration plans
3. Update facility table to reflect accurate status
4. Add personnel for iPSC platform if identified
