# Idea

Digital Health is an important cross-cutting theme at UAlberta that could strengthen the CFI proposal. Multiple groups are developing sensors and digital health devices that could benefit from CTAP as a clinical validation hub:

1. **Digital Health Unit** (NACTRC/Clinical Trials Office) - facilitates testing digital health products
2. **Puneeta Tandon** (Medicine/GI) - Heal-Me and EMPOWER chronic disease management apps
3. **Manisha Gupta** (Engineering) - diabetic wound and neuropathy sensors
4. **HiMARC** (Rehabilitation Medicine) - VR therapy, digital mental health interventions
5. **Other Engineering collaborations** - biosensors and wearables

CTAP could position itself as the **clinical validation platform** for UAlberta's digital health innovation ecosystem.
