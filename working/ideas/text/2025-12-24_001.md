# Idea

Add regulatory compliance matrix for NIST CSF 2.0 alignment to Suite 4 Data Platform documentation.

## Context

The current Suite 4 document includes regulatory compliance tables for 21 CFR Part 11, CDISC, and other clinical trial standards. However, NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF 2.0) is increasingly important for:

- Health Canada data protection requirements
- US federal partner compatibility
- International clinical trial partnerships
- AWS security architecture alignment

## Suggested Implementation

Add to Suite 4, Section "Regulatory Compliance Matrix":

| Standard | Applicability | Implementation |
|----------|---------------|----------------|
| NIST CSF 2.0 | All IT infrastructure | Five core functions: Identify, Protect, Detect, Respond, Recover |

Or create dedicated subsection under Security Architecture:

> **NIST Cybersecurity Framework Alignment**
>
> CTAP's security architecture aligns with NIST CSF 2.0, implementing the five core functions across all data platform components. This alignment ensures compatibility with US federal requirements and supports international clinical trial partnerships requiring demonstrated cybersecurity maturity.
