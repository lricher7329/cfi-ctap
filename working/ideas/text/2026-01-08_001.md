# Idea

David Diachinsky is the Director of the Adult CIU

## Context

This identifies key personnel for Suite 1 (Clinical Trials Infrastructure). The Adult Clinical Investigation Unit (CIU) is a critical component of CTAP's clinical trials capacity. Naming the Director strengthens the team section and demonstrates established leadership.

## Suggested Implementation

1. Add David Diachinsky to team overview with Director, Adult CIU title
2. Reference in Suite 1 description where CIU is discussed
3. Consider requesting letter of support if not already obtained
