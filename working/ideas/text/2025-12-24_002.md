# Idea

The VITAL project based in GEMINI is already funding the OMOP ETL work. This should be described in the proposal and counted as already funded/in-kind contribution.

## Context

VITAL (likely the VITAL network for real-world evidence) and GEMINI are existing initiatives that have already invested in OMOP ETL infrastructure. This represents:

1. **Leveraged investment** - CFI can point to existing work as foundation
2. **Reduced risk** - ETL pipeline is not starting from scratch
3. **Partnership evidence** - Shows cross-project coordination
4. **Cost savings** - Equipment list item for OMOP ETL may be reduced or repositioned

## Suggested Implementation

1. **Suite 4 document**: Add section describing VITAL/GEMINI OMOP work as foundation
2. **Budget narrative**: Note OMOP ETL as partially funded by VITAL
3. **Equipment list**: Consider whether $100,000 OMOP ETL item needs adjustment
4. **Sustainability section**: Reference ongoing VITAL support

Possible text for Suite 4:

> CTAP's OMOP transformation pipeline builds on foundational work funded by the VITAL project through GEMINI. This existing investment provides ETL tooling and OHDSI vocabulary management, enabling CTAP to focus on clinical trials-specific extensions rather than base infrastructure development.
