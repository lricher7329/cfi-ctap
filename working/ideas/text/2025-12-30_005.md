# Idea

Add Lazar Atanackovic to the CFI CTAP team. He works at the intersection of biology and AI and will be joining the University of Alberta.

## Background

**Current Position:**
- Postdoc Fellow at The Broad Institute of MIT-Harvard (Eric & Wendy Schmidt Center)

**Incoming Roles at University of Alberta:**
- Assistant Professor, Electrical & Computer Engineering
- Cross-appointment in Biochemistry
- Amii (Alberta Machine Intelligence Institute) Research Fellow

## Research Focus

His lab develops cutting-edge machine learning methods for understanding and modeling natural (physical) systems from data, with an emphasis on cellular and molecular systems. Research areas include:

- Machine learning and generative modeling
- Causality and causal inference
- Systems biology
- Single-cell biology
- Protein and molecule design

## Key Publications

See Google Scholar: https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=qhTWIh4AAAAJ&hl=en

Notable recent work (2024-2025):
- **Meta Flow Matching** - integrating vector fields on Wasserstein manifolds
- **SuperDiff** - superposition of diffusion models using Itô density estimation
- **DynGFN** - Bayesian inference of gene regulatory networks using GFlowNets
- **Dynamics-based Generative Models** for inference, response prediction, and control of biological systems

## Relevance to CTAP

**Suite 4 (Data Platform) Integration:**
- Generative AI for clinical trial simulation and synthetic data generation
- Causal inference methods for treatment effect estimation
- Integration with CRAIDL (Clinical Research AI & Data Lab)

**Suite 5 (Trial Innovation) Integration:**
- Patient response prediction models
- Biomarker discovery through single-cell analysis
- Molecular and biological systems modeling for trial endpoints

**Cross-Suite Value:**
- Machine learning methods applicable to biorepository data (Suite 2)
- Predictive models for challenge trial outcomes (Suite 1)
- Strong Amii connection enhances Alberta AI ecosystem positioning

## Suggested Implementation

1. Add to team section in RTA with cross-appointment roles
2. Reference Amii fellowship in AI ecosystem narrative
3. Connect to CRAIDL leadership or advisory role
4. Highlight generative modeling expertise in Suite 4 AI capabilities
5. Request letter of collaboration (incoming faculty)

## Action Items

- [ ] Confirm start date at UAlberta
- [ ] Determine appropriate role (Co-Investigator, Collaborator, or Advisory)
- [ ] Request letter of support or collaboration commitment
- [ ] Add to team table with dual appointment notation
