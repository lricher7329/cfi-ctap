# Idea

Integrate research security concepts throughout the CFI CTAP project, positioning the TRE and centralized biobanking infrastructure as critical national security safeguards—not just research tools. Health data is now classified as "dual-use" (valuable for both research and national security), requiring compliance with federal STRAC/NSGRP frameworks.

## Context

The research memo at `ideas/research/research_security.md` identified that:

1. **Health data is dual-use**: Aggregated health datasets are essential for training AI models; foreign adversaries could use Canadian health data for competitive biopharma AI or population vulnerability analysis
2. **CTAP uses Sensitive Technology Research Areas (STRA)**: AI, advanced computing, and large-scale analytics place this work under STRAC oversight
3. **TRE is a compliance engine**: The three-zone architecture automatically enforces STRAC (prevent knowledge transfer) and HIA (least privilege, data sovereignty)
4. **Centralized biobanking reduces risk**: Distributed specimen storage is vulnerable to sample loss, unauthorized access, and diversion

## Implementation Summary

### RTA Section 8.4 (Expanded)
- 8.4.1: Health Data as a National Security Asset
- 8.4.2: Federal Compliance (STRAC/NSGRP)
- 8.4.3: TRE as Security Infrastructure
- 8.4.4: Centralized Biobanking Security
- 8.4.5: Partnership Vetting

### Suite 4 Section 3B (New)
- 3B.1: Sensitive Technology Classification (AI, computing, analytics)
- 3B.2: TRE Security Alignment Matrix
- 3B.3: Strategic Positioning ("safest place in Canada")

### Suite 2 Section 2.4 (New)
- Centralized vs. Distributed Risk comparison table
- Sample loss, unauthorized access, chain of custody, diversion, catastrophic failure

### Include Updates
- Suite 4: Research security paragraph (STRAC/NSGRP, airlock, data sovereignty)
- Suite 2: Security advantage sentence (centralized biobanking, STRAC alignment)

### Brief Updates
- Executive Brief: Research security bullet in "Why Alberta, Why Now"

### NIST CSF 2.0 Update
- Added STRAC/NSGRP alignment note explaining compliance engine role

## Key Terminology Introduced

| Concept | Definition |
|---------|------------|
| **Dual-Use** | Health data valuable for both research and national security |
| **STRAC** | Policy on Sensitive Technology Research and Affiliations of Concern |
| **STRA** | Sensitive Technology Research Areas (AI, computing, analytics) |
| **NRO** | Named Research Organizations (foreign military/security affiliations) |
| **NSGRP** | National Security Guidelines for Research Partnerships |
| **SRO** | UofA Safeguarding Research Office |
| **Airlock** | Output control mechanism preventing bulk data export |
| **Compliance Engine** | Infrastructure that automatically enforces security requirements |
