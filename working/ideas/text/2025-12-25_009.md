# Idea

An important aspect of the TRE integration with the AHS data warehouse and Snowflake is de-identification of unstructured text notes. Dr. Mohamed Abdalla from the University of Alberta has recently published on comparing de-identification algorithms and has expertise in AI sciences that will be critical to CRAIDL. Research is needed to clarify his expertise and add key references for the participant list.

## Key Publications

### 1. LLM-based De-identification Survey (EMNLP 2025)

**Citation:**
Aghakasiri K, Zambare N, Thai J, Ye C, Mehta M, Mitchell JR, **Abdalla M**. Not What the Doctor Ordered: Surveying LLM-based De-identification and Quantifying Clinical Information Loss. EMNLP 2025.

**arXiv:** [2509.14464](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14464)

**Key Findings:**
- Comprehensive survey of LLM-based healthcare de-identification research
- Identifies inconsistent reporting standards preventing meaningful comparisons
- LLMs may inappropriately remove clinically significant information despite near-perfect metrics
- Introduces novel Clinical Information Retention Evaluation (CIRE) approach
- Manual validation by clinical experts revealed poor metric performance

**Relevance to CTAP:**
- Critical for evaluating de-identification of Connect Care clinical notes before TRE ingestion
- Methodology for assessing clinical utility preservation after de-identification
- Directly applicable to Zone 1 → Zone 2 data flow in TRE architecture

### 2. Word Embeddings for Clinical Privacy (JAMIA 2020)

**Citation:**
**Abdalla M**, Abdalla M, Rudzicz F, Hirst G. Using word embeddings to improve the privacy of clinical notes. J Am Med Inform Assoc. 2020;27(6):901-907.

**DOI:** [10.1093/jamia/ocaa038](https://doi.org/10.1093/jamia/ocaa038)

**PMID:** [32388549](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32388549/)

**PMC:** [PMC7309261](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7309261/)

**Key Findings:**
- Novel privacy technique using word embeddings for clinical note anonymization
- Achieves 100% recall on removal of sensitive information
- "Random replacement" method substitutes tokens with neighbouring word vectors
- Enables risk-averse data holders to release clinical texts to researchers
- Addresses family history and other sensitive data not covered by current methods
- Maintains utility for downstream NLP tasks despite readability impact

**Relevance to CTAP:**
- Foundation for de-identification pipeline in Suite 4
- Addresses sensitive information beyond standard PHI (family history, genetic risk)
- Validates utility of de-identified text for machine learning

### 3. PhD Thesis: Rethinking Clinical De-identification (2022)

**Source:** [University of Toronto](https://ftp.cs.toronto.edu/pub/gh/Abdalla-PhD-thesis-2022.pdf)

**Core Hypothesis:**
- De-identification of free-text clinical notes can be done using unsupervised methods
- Reduces human effort required for de-identification
- De-identified notes remain useful for end-to-end machine learning tasks
