# Idea

Peter Light (ADI Director) and Masoud Baghelani (ECE) have developed a novel non-invasive glucose monitoring sensor using microwave resonator technology. This could be incorporated into the CFI proposal in two ways:

1. **Infrastructure for Ongoing Development**: Equipment purchases to advance sensor development
2. **CTAP as Testing Bed**: Use the Suite 5 platform for clinical validation trials

## Research Summary: Non-Invasive Glucose Sensor

### The Technology

**Publication:** "Non-invasive continuous-time glucose monitoring system using a chipless printable sensor based on split ring microwave resonators"
- Journal: Scientific Reports, July 2020
- DOI: 10.1038/s41598-020-69547-1
- PMID: [32737348](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32737348/)

**Research Team:**
- **Masoud Baghelani** - Lead author, Adjunct Professor ECE, formerly Ilam University
- Zahra Abbasi - ECE Department
- Mojgan Daneshmand - ECE Department, M2M Lab
- **Peter E. Light** - ADI Director, Charles A. Allard Chair in Diabetes Research

### How It Works

**Sensor Design:**
- Chip-less tag that can be taped over the skin
- Reader embedded in a smartwatch
- **Zero power consumption** - no active circuitry on tag
- Based on split ring microwave resonator technology

**Technical Performance:**
- Glucose detection accuracy: ~1 mM/L (~18 mg/dL) across physiological range
- Resonance frequency shift: 38 kHz when measuring through skin
- Sensitivity: 60 kHz/mM/L in deionized water, 43 kHz/mM/L with serum
- Superior to traditional microwave resonators (700 MHz vs 200 MHz frequency shift)

**Key Advantages:**
- Non-invasive (no finger pricks, no subcutaneous sensors)
- Continuous real-time monitoring
- Minimal interference from electrolytes and dehydration
- Printable/manufacturable design

### Current Status

- Proof-of-concept demonstrated with laboratory and human skin testing
- Ethics approval obtained from UAlberta Research Ethics Office
- Funded by CIHR and Alberta Diabetes Foundation
- Machine learning approaches being explored for enhanced accuracy

## Integration Opportunities with CFI CTAP

### Option A: Suite 3 - Translational Science Infrastructure

**Concept:** Include sensor development infrastructure in Suite 3 (translational science) to advance the technology toward clinical readiness.

**Potential Infrastructure Needs:**

| Equipment | Purpose | Est. Cost |
|-----------|---------|-----------|
| Microwave network analyzer | Sensor characterization | $50,000-100,000 |
| Cleanroom fabrication access | Sensor manufacturing | Variable |
| Biocompatibility testing equipment | Regulatory preparation | $25,000-50,000 |
| Interstitial fluid simulants | Testing standardization | $10,000 |

**Alignment with Suite 3:**
- Translational research from engineering to clinical application
- Cross-faculty collaboration (Engineering + Medicine + ADI)
- Medical device development pipeline

### Option B: Suite 5 - Clinical Validation Trials

**Concept:** Use CTAP's decentralized trials infrastructure to conduct clinical validation studies of the glucose sensor.

**Trial Design Elements:**

| Component | Suite 5 Capability |
|-----------|-------------------|
| **Participant recruitment** | Connect1d T1D patient network |
| **Remote monitoring** | Telehealth infrastructure |
| **Wearable data collection** | Already included in Suite 5 |
| **eConsent** | Digital consent platform |
| **Data integration** | TRE for CGM comparison studies |

**Proposed Validation Study:**
1. Enroll T1D patients via Connect1d
2. Compare sensor readings to standard CGM (e.g., Dexcom, Libre)
3. Collect continuous data via Suite 5 wearable infrastructure
4. Analyze in TRE alongside Connect Care data

### Option C: Combined Approach

**Concept:** Feature the glucose sensor as a flagship translational project that spans Suite 3 (development) → Suite 5 (validation) → commercialization.

**Narrative Value:**
- Demonstrates discovery-to-clinical pathway
- Highlights ADI as innovation hub
- Shows cross-faculty collaboration
- Links to Connect1d (Peter Senior) for clinical network

## Implementation Summary

**Status: INCORPORATED**

This idea has been integrated into CTAP documentation as part of the Digital Health Device Validation Program:

### Changes Made

| Document | Addition |
|----------|----------|
| **Suite 5** (Section 1.6) | Glucose sensor added to Active Device Pipeline table |
| **Suite 5** (Section 11) | Dr. Peter Light and Dr. Masoud Baghelani added as Research Partners |
| **Suite 4** (Section 5.4) | Connect1d integration updated to reference glucose sensor as device validation use case |
| **Suite 5 Include** | Glucose sensor referenced in Digital Health Device Validation Program bullet |

### Key Decisions

1. **Positioning**: Suite 5 enhancement (Digital Health Device Validation Program) rather than Suite 3
2. **Validation Pathway**: Connect1d provides validation testbed—compare glucose sensor to commercial CGM with EHR endpoints
3. **iSMART Integration**: Sensor development can leverage iSMART's GLP preclinical facility and sensor testing equipment

### Personnel Added

- **Dr. Masoud Baghelani** - Sensor Development - Microwave Glucose (Suites 5)
- **Note**: Peter Light already in Participants table as ADI Director—role updated to include glucose sensor development
