# Idea

Strengthen and expand Equity, Diversity, and Inclusion (EDI) content throughout the CFI CTAP project, aligning with:
- University of Alberta's new **Access, Community, and Belonging (ACB)** framework (January 2025)
- UACT's unique **Indigenous Clinical Trials Unit (ICTU)**—Canada's first
- CIHR's **Strategy for Patient-Oriented Research (SPOR)** principles
- CFI IF2027 EDI requirements

## Three Pillars

1. **Team & Infrastructure Access**: Ensuring diverse teams and equitable access to CTAP infrastructure
2. **Patient-Oriented Research**: Meaningful patient partnership throughout research lifecycle
3. **Inclusive Research Design**: Reaching underrepresented populations with explicit targets

## Context

The research memo at `ideas/research/edi-in-research.md` identified that:

1. **EDI is a weighted CFI criterion** (not "box-checking")—infrastructure must help overcome systemic barriers
2. **CTAP infrastructure should be a "socio-technical system"** embedding EDI in code (IAM roles, bias auditing) and governance (Patient Partners)
3. **UACT has Canada's first ICTU** but it was not mentioned in existing documents
4. **No explicit SPOR framework** despite CIHR requirements for patient partnership
5. **AI bias audit methodology** needed for CRAIDL agents
6. **SGBA+** content was missing

## Implementation Summary

### MASTER.md Section 7 (Expanded from 5 to 8 subsections)

| Section | New Content |
|---------|-------------|
| 7.1 | Team Composition and Inclusive Environment (enhanced with ACB, Dimensions Charter) |
| 7.2 | Systemic Barrier Recognition (existing) |
| 7.3 | Infrastructure Access (enhanced with geographic access, Equity Priority Projects) |
| 7.4 | **NEW**: Research Design: Patient-Oriented Research (SPOR alignment table, CABs) |
| 7.5 | **NEW**: Indigenous Clinical Trials: ICTU Collaboration (OCAP enforcement) |
| 7.6 | **NEW**: AI Equity: Bias Audit Framework (agent accountability table) |
| 7.7 | **NEW**: Sex, Gender, and SGBA+ Integration |
| 7.8 | Broader Impact and Accountability (enhanced with metrics, key quote) |

### MASTER.md Section 4.4 (Flagship Programs)

Added Patient Partnership sections to each flagship:
- **MS Cell Therapies**: MS patient advisory, PROs as endpoints, MS Society partnership
- **Hepatitis C/Vaccines**: Community engagement, harm reduction-informed recruitment
- **Cardio-Renal-Metabolic**: Diabetes Action Canada SPOR integration, Connect1d co-design
- **Rare Disease**: Family partnership, parent/caregiver partners, CORD collaboration

### RTA Section 4 (Expanded from ~10 lines to ~1 page)

New subsections:
- Access, Community, and Belonging (ACB framework)
- Team Composition (Dimensions Charter)
- Patient-Oriented Research (SPOR principles)
- Indigenous Clinical Trials (ICTU, OCAP)
- Systemic Barrier Recognition
- Explicit Participation Targets (15% Indigenous, 20% rural)
- AI Equity and Bias Auditing
- Infrastructure Access
- Broader Impact

### Suite 5 Section 3 (Enhanced)

- **3.1**: Indigenous Community Engagement and ICTU Integration (new detailed table)
- **3.2**: Rural and Remote Access (enhanced)
- **3.3**: Accessibility (enhanced with accessibility types)
- **3.4**: **NEW**: Patient-Oriented Design and Co-Design Methodology

### Agent Guide (Updated)

New sections added to `shared/agent-guides/edi-requirements.md`:
- University of Alberta ACB Framework (2025)
- UACT Indigenous Clinical Trials Unit (ICTU)
- Patient-Oriented Research (SPOR)
- OCAP Principles for Indigenous Data
- CFI IF2027 Specific Requirements
- Key Terminology table

### New Documentation

| Document | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| `docs/methodology/spor-framework.md` | SPOR implementation guide for CTAP |
| `docs/methodology/ictu-collaboration-guide.md` | ICTU collaboration protocols, OCAP enforcement |

## Key Terminology Introduced

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| **ACB** | Access, Community, and Belonging (UAlberta framework) |
| **ICTU** | Indigenous Clinical Trials Unit (Canada's first, within UACT) |
| **SPOR** | Strategy for Patient-Oriented Research (CIHR) |
| **POR** | Patient-Oriented Research |
| **OCAP** | Ownership, Control, Access, Possession (Indigenous data principles) |
| **SGBA+** | Sex and Gender-Based Analysis Plus |
| **LEE** | Lived Experience Expert |
| **CAB** | Community Advisory Board |
| **Dimensions Charter** | Tri-Agency EDI recognition program |

## Participation Targets (Maintained)

| Target | Value | Source |
|--------|-------|--------|
| Indigenous participation | 15% | Objective 2 |
| Rural/remote participation | 20% | Objective 2 |
| HQP from underrepresented groups | 20% of 150+ | Objective 7 |

## Verification Patterns

Grep patterns to verify integration:
- "ACB" or "Access, Community, and Belonging" - MASTER.md, RTA, Suite 5
- "ICTU" - MASTER.md, RTA, Suite 5, agent guide
- "SPOR" - MASTER.md, RTA, agent guide
- "OCAP" - MASTER.md, RTA, Suite 5, ICTU guide
- "Patient-Oriented Research" - MASTER.md, RTA
- "Community Advisory Board" - MASTER.md, Suite 5, SPOR guide
- "SGBA+" - MASTER.md, RTA, agent guide
- "Dimensions Charter" - MASTER.md, RTA
