# Idea

Explore integration between CFI CTAP's Data Platform (Suite 4) and the Digital Health and Discovery Platform (DHDP). DHDP aims to accelerate precision medicine through big data and AI with a federated learning approach. The goal would be to integrate the Suite 4 TRE and on-prem compute infrastructure with DHDP's pan-Canadian network, NOT replace it.

**Personal Context:** Lawrence Richer is a collaborator on a project recently selected to use DHDP's platform (use case differs from CFI application). This existing relationship could facilitate integration discussions.

## Integration Models

### Model A: CTAP as Alberta DHDP Node

**Concept:** CTAP becomes an official DHDP node, with DHDP federated appliance deployed within Suite 4 infrastructure.

**Architecture:**
```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                  DHDP NATIONAL NETWORK                      │
│  [BC Node] ←→ [Alberta/CTAP Node] ←→ [Ontario Node] ←→ ... │
└──────────────────────────┬──────────────────────────────────┘
                           │
                           ▼
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                    CTAP SUITE 4 (ALBERTA)                   │
│  ┌──────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐   │
│  │  Zone 3: Research Environment                         │   │
│  │  ┌────────────────┐  ┌────────────────┐               │   │
│  │  │ DHDP Appliance │  │ CRAIDL Agents  │               │   │
│  │  │ (Federated ML) │  │ (Trial-focused)│               │   │
│  │  └────────────────┘  └────────────────┘               │   │
│  └──────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘   │
│  ┌──────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐   │
│  │  Zone 2: Controlled Processing                        │   │
│  │  [OMOP ETL] [CDISC Transform] [De-identification]     │   │
│  └──────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘   │
│  ┌──────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐   │
│  │  Zone 1: Identifiable (AHS Custody)                   │   │
│  │  [Connect Care] [Consent Registry]                    │   │
│  └──────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘   │

- Access to national cohorts for trial feasibility
- Shared costs for AI development

**Challenges:**
- Governance alignment required
- May require AHS approval for DHDP appliance
- Different timelines (both target 2027)

### Model B: Selective Integration for Specific Use Cases

**Concept:** Rather than full integration, identify specific use cases where CTAP and DHDP collaborate.

**Potential Use Cases:**

1. **Rare Disease Multi-Provincial Feasibility**
   - CTAP provides Alberta cohort via federated query
   - DHDP provides national cohort across provinces
   - Combined feasibility for RareKids Network trials

2. **AI Biomarker Development**
   - CRAIDL Protocol Agent designs trial
   - DHDP federated learning trains biomarker model
   - CTAP validates in prospective trial

3. **MS Cell Therapy Trials**
   - DHDP's neurology focus aligns with MS Flagship
   - Federated pre-trial biomarker identification
   - CTAP executes prospective validation

4. **Oncology-Adjacent Trials**
   - Rare pediatric cancers from RareKids
   - DHDP's Terry Fox oncology expertise
   - CTAP's trial execution infrastructure

**Advantages:**
- Lower integration complexity
- Use case-driven collaboration
- Maintains autonomy of both platforms

### Model C: Standards Harmonization Partnership

**Concept:** Focus on harmonizing data standards and interoperability rather than technical integration.

**Joint Activities:**

1. **OMOP Adoption**
   - CTAP's OMOP expertise shared with DHDP sites
   - Common vocabulary mappings for Alberta
   - Federation protocol alignment

2. **FHIR Implementation**
   - Both platforms use HL7 FHIR
   - Connect Care FHIR patterns shared nationally
   - Real-time data exchange standards

3. **Governance Templates**
   - Data use agreements
   - Ethics templates for federated research
   - Privacy impact assessment frameworks

**Advantages:**
- Lowest risk integration
- Benefits entire Canadian ecosystem
- Positions Alberta as leader in standards

## Strategic Considerations

### Alignment with CFI Priorities

- **National Impact:** DHDP integration extends CTAP's reach beyond Alberta
- **Avoiding Duplication:** Shows coordination with major federal investment
- **Leverage:** $49M+ federal investment in DHDP becomes complementary to CFI ask

### Potential Concerns

1. **Scope Creep:** Integration adds complexity to already ambitious CFI proposal
2. **Timeline Mismatch:** Both projects target 2027 - coordination needed
3. **Governance Complexity:** TFRI leadership vs. CFI institutional model
4. **Data Jurisdiction:** Multi-provincial data requires multiple HIAs

### Lawrence Richer's Existing Connection

The fact that Lawrence is already a collaborator on a DHDP-selected project provides:
- Credibility in discussions
- Understanding of DHDP processes
- Potential for letter of support from DHDP/TFRI
- Demonstration of track record with national initiatives
