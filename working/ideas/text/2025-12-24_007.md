# Idea

The ADI Clinical Research Unit (CRU) - https://www.ualberta.ca/en/alberta-diabetes/clinical-research/clinical-research-unit.html - needs to be integrated with Suite 1. This unit is located in the Li Ka Shing Centre for Health Research Innovation which is also the location of the Li Ka Shing Institute of Virology. Please do research and plan to implement in the Suite 1 plans. I think the Challenge Unit needs to be developed within Suite 1, but separate from the other aspects. We will need to identify space for this that is separate and will likely require separate decision making and approval - causing some risk it needs to be removed from our plan.

## Suite 1: Integrated Clinical Research Facilities Model

### Three CIU/CRU Facilities in CTAP Network

Based on research from Ideas 006 and 007, Suite 1 should describe a **network of three complementary clinical research facilities**:

| Facility | Location | Primary Function | CTAP Role |
|----------|----------|------------------|-----------|
| **Adult CIU** | UAH Unit 2C3 (MacKenzie Centre) | Phase I-IV trials, general adult | Upgrade monitoring, add POC lab, IP pharmacy |
| **Pediatric CIU** | Stollery (Oilers Clinic) | Phase I pediatric, rare disease | Add rare disease equipment ($200K) |
| **ADI CRU** | Li Ka Shing Centre | Phase II-III metabolic, diabetes | Integrate with CTAP network; potential Challenge Unit site |

### ADI CRU Integration Benefits

1. **Metabolic Expertise**: Body composition, calorimetry, nutrition assessment complement cardio-renal-metabolic flagship program
2. **Virology Proximity**: Same building as Li Ka Shing Institute of Virology and Dr. Houghton's vaccine program
3. **BSL Capability**: Building already has BSL-2 and BSL-3 containment laboratories
4. **cGMP Infrastructure**: Adjacent to ACTM cell manufacturing (7th-8th floors)
5. **NACTRC Partnership**: Already integrated with NACTRC clinical trials network

## Challenge Trial Unit: Siting Analysis

### Option A: Li Ka Shing Centre (Preferred)

| Factor | Assessment |
|--------|------------|
| **Proximity to Virology Institute** | Excellent - same building as Dr. Houghton's lab |
| **Existing BSL capability** | BSL-2 and BSL-3 already present |
| **Air handling infrastructure** | Building designed for containment; may be adaptable |
| **Hospital proximity** | 240m to UAH; adequate for emergency response |
| **Decision authority** | University of Alberta Facilities & Operations |
| **Alignment with Houghton program** | Direct alignment - enables HCV vaccine challenge studies |

**Advantages:**
- Co-location with Li Ka Shing Applied Virology Institute
- Existing containment infrastructure (BSL-2/3)
- Direct connection to vaccine development program
- University-controlled space (easier approval than hospital)

**Challenges:**
- Would require identification of suitable space within building
- May need renovation for negative pressure isolation rooms
- Space allocation decision needed from University

### Option B: Kipnes Health Research Academy (Alternative)

| Factor | Assessment |
|--------|------------|
| **New construction** | Purpose-built opportunity |
| **Design flexibility** | Can specify -25 Pa, HEPA, airlocks from inception |
| **Timeline** | Depends on Kipnes construction schedule |
| **Decision authority** | Kipnes governance + University |
| **Alignment with Houghton program** | Less direct than Li Ka Shing location |

**Advantages:**
- Purpose-built design avoids retrofit constraints
- Part of new research precinct vision

**Challenges:**
- Separates Challenge Unit from Virology Institute
- Depends on Kipnes construction timeline
- May not be available for CFI IF2027 activation window

### Option C: UAH Hospital Renovation (Not Recommended)

Based on Idea 006 research, hospital-based challenge facilities are possible (cf. Royal Free Hospital, London) but the existing Adult CIU is unsuitable due to:
- 4-bed ward configuration (not single isolation rooms)
- No negative pressure capability
- Extended quarantine (14+ days) incompatible with day-procedure design

## Risk Analysis: Challenge Unit in Suite 1

### Identified Risk

> "We will need to identify space for this that is separate and will likely require separate decision making and approval - causing some risk it needs to be removed from our plan."

### Risk Characterization

| Risk Element | Description | Likelihood | Impact |
|--------------|-------------|------------|--------|
| **Space availability** | Li Ka Shing or Kipnes may not have suitable space | Medium | High |
| **Approval timeline** | Space allocation decisions may extend beyond RTA deadline | Medium | High |
| **Renovation scope** | HVAC/containment retrofit costs may exceed budget | Low | Medium |
| **Governance complexity** | Multiple stakeholders (University, Virology Institute, Facilities) | Medium | Medium |
| **Budget uncertainty** | $490K estimate based on new construction; retrofit may differ | Medium | Medium |

### Risk Mitigation Strategies

| Strategy | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **A: Modular presentation** | Present Challenge Unit as distinct component with independent justification |
| **B: Contingent budget** | Allocate Challenge Unit budget as contingent pending space confirmation |
| **C: Li Ka Shing engagement** | Early engagement with Virology Institute and Facilities on space options |
| **D: Phased approach** | Challenge Unit as Phase 2 if space not confirmed for Phase 1 |
| **E: Alternative funding** | Identify complementary funding (e.g., Virology Institute, Government of Alberta) |

### Recommended Approach

**Present Challenge Unit as a distinct Sub-Section 1.5.x within Suite 1 with:**

1. Clear identification of space requirements and decision dependencies
2. Explicit statement that location is subject to University space allocation
3. Reference to Li Ka Shing Centre as preferred site (alignment with Virology Institute)
4. Contingency language allowing budget reallocation if Challenge Unit not feasible
5. Strong strategic justification linking to Nobel laureate program and pandemic preparedness

## Suggested Suite 1 Document Revisions

### 1. Add Section on Clinical Research Facility Network

Describe Suite 1 as **enhancing an existing network** of three facilities:

```markdown
## 1.0 Clinical Research Facility Network

CTAP's clinical infrastructure investments enhance three established clinical research units:

| Facility | Location | Existing Capability | CTAP Enhancement |
|----------|----------|---------------------|------------------|
| Adult CIU | UAH MacKenzie Centre | 8-bed Phase I-IV, Level 2 containment | POC lab, IP pharmacy automation |
| Pediatric CIU | Stollery Oilers Clinic | Phase I pediatric (1 of 2 in Canada) | Rare disease equipment, telehealth |
| ADI CRU | Li Ka Shing Centre | Phase II-III metabolic, 8,000 sq ft | Network integration, metabolic flagship support |
```

### 2. Revise Challenge Unit Section

Make siting and approval status explicit:

```markdown
### 1.5 Vaccine Challenge Trial Unit

**Budget: $490,000** *(Subject to space allocation confirmation)*

**Preferred Location:** Li Ka Shing Centre for Health Research Innovation

The Challenge Unit is proposed for co-location with the Li Ka Shing Applied Virology Institute,
enabling direct integration with Dr. Michael Houghton's hepatitis C vaccine program. The Li Ka Shing
Centre already houses BSL-2 and BSL-3 containment laboratories, providing foundational infrastructure
for controlled human infection model (CHIM) studies.

**Space Allocation Status:** Subject to University of Alberta Facilities approval. CFI investment
is contingent on confirmed space availability. Alternative locations (Kipnes Health Research Academy)
are under consideration if Li Ka Shing Centre space is not available.
```

### 3. Add Risk Acknowledgment

Include in RTA or full application:

```markdown
## Space and Governance Dependencies

The Vaccine Challenge Trial Unit ($490,000) requires dedicated space with negative pressure
isolation capability. The preferred location is the Li Ka Shing Centre for Health Research
Innovation, co-located with the Li Ka Shing Applied Virology Institute. Space allocation is
subject to University approval, with confirmation anticipated by [date]. If suitable space
is not available, the Challenge Unit budget may be reallocated to other Suite 1 components
or deferred to a subsequent funding phase.
```
