# Suite 5: Tighten Digital Health Device Validation Focus

## Source
CFI-CTAP Grant Proposal Review (Antigravity Agent, January 2026)

## Priority
MEDIUM

## Context
Reviewer rates Suite 5 as "Strong" with excellent "Equity as Infrastructure" narrative, but cautions against scope creep.

## Recommendation
Frame Digital Health Device Validation strictly as "validating the sensors that feed the AI," not as a generic startup incubator.

## Actions Required
1. **Sharpen Purpose Statement**:
   - NOT: "A platform for validating digital health devices"
   - YES: "Validation infrastructure ensuring that sensors feeding CRAIDL meet clinical-grade accuracy"

2. **Explicitly Connect to AI Pipeline**:
   - Device → Sensor Data → Suite 4 TRE → CRAIDL Agent
   - "Every validated device becomes a CRAIDL training data source"

3. **Example Refinement**:
   > Before: "The Digital Health Device Validation Program will test novel sensors including the Light/Baghelani microwave glucose monitor."

   > After: "The Digital Health Device Validation Program ensures that novel sensors—such as the Light/Baghelani microwave glucose monitor—produce data streams compatible with CRAIDL's analytical requirements. Validated devices enter the Suite 4 device registry, enabling AI agents to incorporate their outputs into trial monitoring workflows."

4. **Remove Generic Language**:
   - Avoid: "startup incubator," "device commercialization," "accelerator"
   - Use: "clinical validation," "sensor calibration," "AI-compatible data streams"
