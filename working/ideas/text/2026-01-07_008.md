# CRAIDL: Strengthen Agent Maturity Differentiation

## Source
CFI-CTAP Grant Proposal Review (Antigravity Agent, January 2026)

## Priority
HIGH

## Context
Reviewer notes potential concern about AI Agent Maturity: "While 'Jenkins' (AI Scribe) is a proven anchor, the 'Protocol Agent' and 'Events Agent' are less defined. Reviewers may question the leap from 'LLM transcription' to 'autonomous trial design.'"

## Recommendation
Clearly differentiate agent maturity levels and anchor less-mature agents to proven methodologies.

## Actions Required
1. **Add Agent Maturity Matrix** showing development stage for each agent:

   | Agent | TRL | Validation Status | Anchor |
   |-------|-----|-------------------|--------|
   | AI Scribe (Jenkins) | 9 | AHS production deployed | AHS production |
   | Protocol Agent | 6 | Prototype validated | CVC templates (50+) |
   | Data Management Agent | 6 | Prototype validated | SPIRIT 2025, ICH E6(R3) |
   | Ethics Agent | 6 | Prototype validated | HREB templates |
   | Regulatory Agent | 5 | Design validated | CDISC standards |
   | Events Agent | 4 | Concept demonstrated | EMR safety triggers |
   | Budget Agent | 4 | Concept demonstrated | CVC benchmarks |
   | In Silico Agent | 3 | Research prototype | Meta Flow Matching |

2. **Strengthen Protocol Agent Description**:
   - Anchor to CVC's 50+ trial templates as training/validation corpus
   - Emphasize SPIRIT 2025 compliance as objective standard
   - Reference prototype validation results

3. **For Less-Mature Agents**:
   - Acknowledge developmental status explicitly
   - Describe staged deployment timeline
   - Identify validation milestones before deployment

4. **Emphasize Human-in-the-Loop Throughout**:
   - "Agents operate as tireless assistants—drafting documents, checking compliance, simulating scenarios—but all critical decisions remain under human investigator authority"
   - This addresses "leap from transcription to autonomous design" concern

## Suggested Text Addition
> **Staged Agent Deployment:** CRAIDL agents vary in maturity. AI Scribe (Jenkins) is production-validated within AHS, demonstrating that clinical AI integration is achievable. Protocol, Data Management, Ethics, and Regulatory Agents have prototype validation through investigator-developed infrastructure. Events, Budget, and In Silico Agents are earlier-stage, with deployment planned for Year 3-4 following validation against established ground truth. This staged approach ensures each agent meets clinical-grade reliability before deployment.
