# Idea

Add Amber Simpson to the CFI CTAP team and integrate her expertise into the proposal.

## Background

**Current Position:**
- Canada Research Chair in Biomedical Computing and Informatics
- Queen's University
- Lab: simpsonlab.org

**Citation Metrics:**
- 9,019 total citations (7,962 since 2020)
- h-index: 42
- i10-index: 90

## Research Focus

- Artificial intelligence applications in healthcare
- Medical imaging analysis
- Computational oncology
- Translational research bridging basic science and clinical practice

## Key Expertise Areas

1. **Radiomics and Quantitative Imaging** - Extracting quantitative features from medical images for prediction
2. **Machine Learning in Oncology** - AI for cancer detection, prognosis, and treatment planning
3. **Image-Guided Surgery** - Surgical planning and navigation systems
4. **Cancer Biomarker Discovery** - Computational approaches to biomarker identification
5. **Federated Learning** - Privacy-preserving distributed AI for rare disease detection

## Notable Publications

- **Medical Segmentation Decathlon** (1,622 citations) - Benchmark datasets for medical imaging AI
- **Extracellular Vesicle Biomarkers in Cancer** (1,219 citations) - Biomarker discovery
- **Federated Learning for Rare Cancer Detection** (383 citations) - Privacy-preserving AI across institutions
- Radiomics for pancreatic cancer survival prediction
- Preoperative assessment of hepatocellular carcinoma

## Relevance to CTAP

**Suite 2 (Living Biorepository) Integration:**
- Biomarker discovery from biospecimen data
- Extracellular vesicle and liquid biopsy analysis
- Computational pathology integration

**Suite 3 (Translational Science) Integration:**
- Bridge between basic science and clinical trials
- Cancer biomarker translation to trial endpoints
- Computational oncology for trial design

**Suite 4 (Data Platform) Integration:**
- Federated learning expertise directly relevant to TRE architecture
- Medical imaging AI integration with CRAIDL
- Radiomics pipelines for trial endpoint assessment
- Privacy-preserving analytics across institutions

**Cross-Cutting Value:**
- CRC status provides credibility and funding leverage
- Queen's connection expands pan-Canadian network
- Federated learning expertise essential for multi-site trial data
- Strong publication record supports AI claims in proposal

- Lab website: simpsonlab.org

## Suggested Implementation

1. Add to team section with CRC designation prominently featured
2. Reference federated learning expertise in Suite 4 TRE section
3. Connect to imaging-based trial endpoints in Suite 3
4. Highlight pan-Canadian collaboration (Queen's-Alberta axis)
5. Potential role: Co-Investigator or Advisory Board for AI/imaging

## Action Items

- [ ] Reach out to Amber Simpson for collaboration interest
- [ ] Determine appropriate role (Co-I, Collaborator, or Advisory)
- [ ] Request letter of support highlighting federated learning collaboration
- [ ] Add to team table with CRC designation
- [ ] Reference Medical Segmentation Decathlon work in AI capabilities section
