# Idea

Need to incorporate improvements in search functionality to BeTheCure.ca to facilitate easier trial discovery by participants. A semantic search would be best. The integration could be linked to Suite 1 and Suite 4 and aims to improve EDI in clinical trials.

## Context

BeTheCure.ca is Alberta's clinical trial registry that helps patients and caregivers find clinical trials. Current search functionality relies on keyword matching which can miss relevant trials if participants don't use the exact terminology researchers use.

**Current Limitations:**
- Keyword-based search misses semantic equivalents (e.g., "heart attack" vs "myocardial infarction")
- Underrepresented populations may use different terminology
- Language barriers limit discovery for non-English speakers
- Health literacy variations affect search success

**Opportunity:**
- CTAP's CRAIDL infrastructure (Suite 4) could power semantic search using LLMs
- Natural language queries: "trials for people who just had a stroke"
- Multi-language support for diverse communities
- Plain-language matching to medical terminology

## Connection to CTAP Infrastructure

**Suite 1 (Clinical Trials Infrastructure):**
- Improved recruitment directly benefits trial operations
- More diverse participant pools align with EDI objectives
- Better matching reduces screening failures

**Suite 4 (Data Platform):**
- CRAIDL AI agents could power semantic understanding
- LLM infrastructure already planned for trial operations
- FHIR integration could link patient records to matching trials (with consent)

## EDI Implications

This enhancement directly addresses CFI's EDI requirements:

1. **Reducing Barriers:**
   - Removes specialized terminology requirement
   - Supports multiple languages
   - Accommodates different health literacy levels

2. **Improving Access:**
   - Rural and remote participants can find trials easier
   - Indigenous communities can search in plain language
   - Elderly and differently-abled users benefit from simpler interface

3. **Increasing Diversity:**
   - Better matching increases participation from underrepresented groups
   - Removes unconscious bias in keyword-dependent discovery
   - Enables community-specific outreach with tailored search

## Suggested Implementation

1. **Infrastructure Linkage:**
   - Add BeTheCure.ca semantic search to Suite 4 AI/LLM infrastructure
   - Include API development for trial registry integration
   - Budget compute resources for inference

2. **Development Approach:**
   - Fine-tune LLM on clinical trial terminology
   - Implement embedding-based semantic search
   - Add multi-language support (French, Indigenous languages)

3. **Equipment Considerations:**
   - GPU compute in Suite 4 already supports this
   - May need to budget for inference serving infrastructure
   - Consider edge deployment for faster responses

4. **Metrics:**
   - Track search success rates by demographic
   - Measure trial enrollment diversity before/after
   - Monitor user satisfaction across populations
