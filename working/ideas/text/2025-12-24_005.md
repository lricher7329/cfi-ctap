# Idea

The concept of a rare disease clinical trials unit is not fully developed in the Suite 1 proposal. A thorough background web search is needed to understand the requirements for this unit. Clear governance and support from the healthcare system partners including the Stollery Children's Hospital (Christine Westerlund) and the University of Alberta Hospital (Mishayla Houle) will be required for this aspect of the proposal.

## Status: IMPLEMENTED

This idea has been researched and implemented. See changes below.

## Research Conducted

### Canadian Rare Disease Infrastructure

**RareKids-CAN Network:**
- Funded early 2024 by CIHR Institute of Genetics as part of Canada's National Strategy for Drugs for Rare Diseases
- Collaboration between patient groups, clinicians, researchers, and industry
- Goal: Ensure every Canadian child with rare disease has access to effective treatments
- [SickKids Toronto](https://lab.research.sickkids.ca/enrich/research-projects/rarekids-can/) serves as coordinating centre

**Canadian Rare Disease Network (CRDN):**
- Launched February 29, 2024
- Brings together patient groups, clinicians, and researchers
- Focus: Reducing diagnostic time, expanding treatment, connecting research nationally

**Canadian Organization for Rare Disorders (CORD):**
- National network representing 1 in 12 Canadians with rare disorders
- Advocating for $1.4B federal rare disease drug funding deployment

**WCHRI Data Coordinating Centre (Edmonton):**
- Supports pediatric clinical trials data management
- Part of Innovation in Paediatric Clinical Trials (iPCT) network

### Stollery Children's Hospital Context

| Attribute | Detail |
|-----------|--------|
| **Location** | 8440 112 Street NW, Edmonton (within UAH) |
| **Capacity** | 218 beds, largest pediatric hospital in Western Canada |
| **Catchment** | Largest in North America (AB, BC, SK, MB, Territories) |
| **Patients** | 316,000+ annually |
| **Phase I Capability** | One of only TWO Canadian children's hospitals authorized for Phase I trials |
| **Clinical Investigation Unit** | Located in Oilers Ambulatory Clinic, 2nd floor north side |

### International Exemplars

**NIH Rare Diseases Clinical Research Network (RDCRN):**
- 21 consortia + Data Management and Coordinating Center (DMCC)
- 350+ sites in US, 50+ sites in 22 other countries
- 56,000+ participants enrolled
- $31.6M funding for FY2025

**Boston Children's Hospital:**
- Children's Rare Disease Collaborative (CRDC): 100+ physician-scientists
- Manton Center for Orphan Disease Research (founded 2008)
- World's largest pediatric hospital-based research enterprise

**SickKids Toronto:**
- Clinical Research Centre with clinical investigation unit
- First clinical RNA sequencing platform in Canada for rare disease diagnostics
- Cellular Therapy Facility for gene therapies

### Gene Therapy Monitoring Requirements

- FDA/Health Canada mandate 15+ year follow-up for gene therapies
- Annual hematologic surveillance (CBC with differential)
- Integration site analysis as warranted
- Pediatric-to-adult care transition planning

### Integration with Challenge Trial Unit

**Analysis determined: Partial integration with distinct specialized zones**

| Requirement | Challenge Trial Unit | Rare Disease Unit | Integration |
|-------------|---------------------|-------------------|-------------|
| Negative pressure | Required (-25 Pa) | Not required | Separate |
| Isolation | Required (14+ days) | Outpatient focus | Separate |
| Monitoring equipment | Continuous 24/7 | Episodic | Shared |
| POC laboratory | Pathogen focus | Metabolic focus | Shared |
| IP pharmacy | Pathogen handling | Gene therapy IP | Shared |
| Location | Kipnes precinct | Stollery CIU | Separate |

## Implementation Completed

### Suite 1 Document Updates
- Added Section 1.6: Pediatric Rare Disease Clinical Trials Unit ($200,000 CTAP)
- Added extensive Section 3: Background and Rationale with subsections 3.1-3.8
- Updated budget from $2,190,000 to $2,390,000
- Added integration analysis (Section 3.7)

### Budget Decision
- **User selected**: Stollery co-investment model
- CTAP investment: $200,000 (equipment)
- Stollery Foundation: $200,000 in-kind (family spaces, fit-out)
- **Total unit value: $400,000** (50% CTAP, 50% Stollery)
- **Location**: Existing Stollery CIU (Oilers Ambulatory Clinic)

### Google Sheets Updates
- Added 5 equipment items to Equipment tab (IDs 42-46)
- Added Todd Alexander and Christine Westerlund to Participants tab

### RTA Updates
- Enhanced Pediatric Rare Disease Trials flagship program section
- Added specific infrastructure details, Stollery partnership, RareKids-CAN connection

### Brief and Include Updates
- Updated Suite 1 brief with rare disease capability
- Updated includes/suite_1_description.md
