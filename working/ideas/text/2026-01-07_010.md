# Figures and Visuals: Ensure High-Quality Diagrams

## Source
CFI-CTAP Grant Proposal Review (Antigravity Agent, January 2026)

## Priority
HIGH

## Context
Reviewer notes: "The text mentions diagrams (TRE architecture, Data Flow). Ensure these are high-quality, as they will do 50% of the explanatory work for the AI agent interactions."

## Recommendation
Invest in professional-quality figures that explain:
1. Three-Zone TRE Architecture
2. CRAIDL Agent interactions
3. Data flow from Connect Care through AI to outputs
4. Suite interdependencies

## Actions Required
1. **Review existing figures** in `figures/` directory
2. **TRE Architecture Diagram**:
   - Should clearly show Zone 1/2/3 separation
   - Data flow arrows with labels
   - Security boundaries
   - Where each CRAIDL agent operates

3. **CRAIDL Agent Interaction Diagram**:
   - Show all 7-8 agents
   - Illustrate coordination between agents
   - Human-in-the-loop checkpoints
   - Data sources accessed by each

4. **Suite Interdependency Diagram**:
   - Physical suites (1) connected to data (4) and AI (4)
   - Biorepository (2) bidirectional flow with TRE (4)
   - Omics (3) sample-to-data pipeline
   - Wearables (5) feeding into TRE (4)

5. **Format Considerations**:
   - Vector graphics (SVG/PDF) for scalability
   - Consistent color scheme across all figures
   - Professional typography
   - Print-ready resolution (300 DPI minimum for raster)

## Priority Figures
1. **CTAP Overview** (already exists: ctap-overall-prefered.png) - verify quality
2. **TRE Three-Zone Architecture** - needs creation/refinement
3. **CRAIDL Agent Architecture** - needs creation
4. **Data Flow: Connect Care → TRE → Research Outputs** - needs creation
