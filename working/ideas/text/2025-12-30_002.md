# Idea

Implement a "Local Compliance, International Harmonization" regulatory framework across the CFI CTAP project, ensuring Canadian regulatory requirements are primary while enabling multi-jurisdictional collaboration.

## Context

The original CTAP documentation over-emphasized US-centric regulations (21 CFR Part 11) without explaining their relevance to a Canadian platform. This created potential confusion about primary compliance requirements and could misrepresent the project's regulatory approach to Canadian funders.

## Research Findings

### Canadian Primary Regulatory Framework

| Regulation | Authority | Scope |
|------------|-----------|-------|
| **Health Canada Division 5** | Health Canada | All drug clinical trials in Canada |
| **ICH E6(R3)** | Health Canada (mandatory April 1, 2026) | Good Clinical Practice |
| **TCPS2 (2022)** | Tri-Council | Research ethics |
| **Health Information Act (HIA)** | Alberta | AHS custodian data |
| **CAN/CGSB-72.34-2017** | Canadian Standards | Electronic records as documentary evidence |

### Key Finding: 21 CFR Part 11 Context

21 CFR Part 11 is a US FDA regulation, NOT a Canadian requirement. It remains relevant only for:
- Trials intended for FDA submission (US market access)
- Multi-national trials with US sites
- Industry-sponsored trials planning dual submissions

For Canadian-only trials, compliance requires ICH E6(R3), Health Canada Division 5, and CAN/CGSB-72.34-2017.

### Critical Timeline

**ICH E6(R3) becomes mandatory in Canada: April 1, 2026**

## Implementation Summary

### Suite 4 Data Platform
- Added new Section 3A: "Regulatory Governance: Local Compliance, International Harmonization"
- Created three-layer compliance architecture diagram
- Revised Section 6 compliance matrix with Jurisdiction and Applicability columns
- Updated all 21 CFR Part 11 references to be properly qualified

### RTA
- Updated Domain 3 TRE description to prioritize Health Canada requirements
- Added "Regulatory Harmonization" paragraph explaining tiered compliance
- Revised Domain 4 compliance table

### Briefs
- Suite 4 Brief: Restructured compliance matrix into Primary/International/Federation sections
- Executive Brief: Revised table with Canadian requirements first

### Includes
- Suite 4 Description: Added harmonization statement, updated Zone 2 compliance description

### Suite 2 Biorepository
- Updated OpenSpecimen compliance descriptions to reflect Canadian primary compliance

## Core Principle

**Local Compliance, International Harmonization**: CTAP meets Alberta/Canadian requirements as primary compliance (Health Canada Division 5, ICH E6(R3), TCPS2, HIA), while providing optional international modules (21 CFR Part 11, EU Annex 11) for multi-jurisdictional trials.

## Verification Patterns

Grep patterns to verify correct implementation:
- "Health Canada Division 5" - should appear before 21 CFR Part 11 references
- "ICH E6(R3)" - should note April 2026 mandatory date
- "21 CFR Part 11" - should always be qualified as "FDA" or "optional"
- "local compliance, international harmonization" - key phrase in multiple documents
