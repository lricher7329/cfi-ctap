# MASTER.md: Strengthen "Why Now" Urgency with 2027 Window

## Source
CFI-CTAP Grant Proposal Review (Antigravity Agent, January 2026)

## Priority
HIGH

## Context
Reviewer recommends strengthening the "Why Now" argument to emphasize the unique 2027 timing window.

## Recommendation
Emphasize that the convergence of Connect Care (fully live 2024), AI maturity (LLMs 2024-2025), and Biomanufacturing (CMPC online 2026) creates a specific 2027 window that cannot be missed.

## Actions Required
1. **Add "Convergence Window" subsection** to §2.1 (Why Now):
   > **The 2027 Convergence Window**
   >
   > Three infrastructure maturation timelines converge in 2027—creating a unique opportunity that will not recur:
   >
   > 1. **Connect Care Maturation (2020-2024)**: Province-wide Epic deployment completed 2024. Data warehouse now contains 4+ years of longitudinal records. FHIR API capabilities proven. This is the first year with sufficient historical depth for population-scale AI training.
   >
   > 2. **AI Capability Threshold (2023-2025)**: Large Language Models crossed the clinical reasoning threshold in 2023-2024. Agentic AI frameworks (multi-agent coordination) matured in 2025. Evidence base for AI in clinical trials now includes 50+ publications validating component-level gains.
   >
   > 3. **Biomanufacturing Capacity (2024-2026)**: PRAIRIE Hub funded 2024. CMPC construction completes 2026. Canada's largest pharmaceutical manufacturing capacity (70M+ doses/year) comes online precisely when clinical validation infrastructure is needed.
   >
   > **Waiting is not neutral.** Each year of delay:
   > - Allows competing centres to establish first-mover advantages
   > - Wastes Connect Care data that could be training AI models
   > - Leaves CMPC-manufactured products without local clinical validation pathways
   > - Risks losing AI talent to better-resourced international programs

2. **Add "Window Closure Risk"**: Note what happens if CFI 2027 is missed—next major CFI competition may be 3-5 years out.
