# Idea

Update pricing data for OpenSpecimen based on https://www.openspecimen.org/pricing/

## Context

OpenSpecimen is the biobank LIMS selected for Suite 2 (Living Biorepository). Current pricing from the OpenSpecimen website (January 2026):

### OpenSpecimen Editions

| Edition | One-Time Cost | Users | Hosting |
|---------|---------------|-------|---------|
| **Institutional Biobank** | USD 150,000 | Unlimited | On-premise or cloud |
| **Medium-Scale Biobank** | USD 100,000 | Up to 10 (per-user fee) | Cloud only (USA, EU, AU) |
| **Starter Biobank** | USD 75,000 | Up to 5 (per-user fee) | Cloud only (USA, EU, AU) |

### Additional Services

| Service | Cost | Notes |
|---------|------|-------|
| Annual Support | USD 30,000+/year | End-user/technical support, server/database management, free upgrades |
| Integrations | USD 35,000 (one-time) | REDCap, Epic, Cerner, freezers, rack scanners; annual fees apply |
| Data Migration | USD 40,000 (one-time) | Migration from existing databases |

### Key Differentiator

Unlimited users licensing eliminates per-user restrictions common in competing LIMS products, allowing organizations to add staff without incremental costs.

## Implementation

   - New total: $595,000 CAD for OpenSpecimen platform

2. **Suite 2 Brief** ([suite_2_biospecimen.md](../briefs/suite_2_biospecimen.md)):
   - Added new "Software Platform: OpenSpecimen" section
   - Itemized all software costs with descriptions
   - Updated suite budget from $3,290,000 to $3,885,000
