# Idea

Add reference to https://smartinstitute.ca/rehabilitation-innovations/ in suite 1

## Context

The SMART Institute Rehabilitation Innovations core develops interventions that harness multiple networks in the nervous system for restoring function through training strategies enhanced with pharmacological support, cell therapies, and devices.

## Implementation

Added to Suite 1 Clinical Trials Infrastructure:

1. Updated facility network table (Section 1) with SMART Institute row
2. Added new subsection 1.0.4 "SMART Institute Rehabilitation Innovations" with:
   - Facility overview (Katz Group Centre, 11 buildings, 100+ equipment pieces)
   - Research focus areas (neuroplasticity, mobility restoration, spasticity, etc.)
   - Equipment table (FES systems, exoskeletons, motion capture, EMG, TMS, gait analysis)
   - Strategic value for CTAP (5 integration points)
