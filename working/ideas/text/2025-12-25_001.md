# Idea

The CFI proposal should discuss the creation of a new biobank or build on an existing one. The Alberta Diabetes Institute IsletCore provides an excellent model of a successful research-focused core biorepository. The proposal should explore how this model could integrate with the Living Biorepository concept, and identify new or existing biobank projects that could serve as additional use cases.

## Research Summary: Biorepository Models and Integration Opportunities

### 1. Alberta Diabetes Institute IsletCore Model

**Overview:** The ADI IsletCore is a human islet isolation, research, distribution, and biobanking facility established in 2010 with $1.4M joint investment from Alberta Diabetes Foundation and University of Alberta.

**Key Success Factors:**
- **Research-specific focus**: Uses pancreata not accepted for clinical transplant, including donors with T1D and T2D
- **Quality over yield**: Prioritizes islet purity (median 85%) over total yield
- **International distribution**: Serves laboratories worldwide
- **Written informed research consent**: Clear governance for research use

**Relevance to Suite 2:**
- Demonstrates successful Alberta-based core facility model
- Shows integration of specialized processing with distribution network
- Model for consent-based research specimen management
- Already established research community and international reputation

### 2. Canadian Biorepository Infrastructure

**Canadian Tissue Repository Network (CTRNet):**
- Established with CIHR/ICR funding
- Biobank Certification Program since 2011
- 251 biobanks engaged, 40 fully certified (as of 2018)
- Education modules aligned with ISBER Best Practices, 5th Edition

**Canadian BioSample Repository (CBSR):**
- Operates since 2000
- 1,137,000+ samples stored
- Developed open-source BioBank software (modelled on NCI caTissue)
- Cost-recovery model for investigator-initiated studies globally

**Relevance:** CBSR is already identified as Suite 2's primary biorepository operator. The proposal could strengthen the connection to CTRNet certification and national standards.

### 3. International Models: UK Biobank

**Scale and Approach:**
- 500,000 participants, 15+ million biological samples
- 30+ petabytes of data
- Continuous EHR linkage (death registries, cancer registries, primary/secondary care)
- Algorithmically-derived health outcomes

**Key Innovations:**
- Cloud-based Research Analysis Platform (UKB-RAP) launched 2021
- 30,000 researchers from 90+ countries registered
- 9,000+ peer-reviewed publications (3,000+ in 2023 alone)

**Lessons for Suite 2:**
- Centralized infrastructure with industrial approaches
- Streamlined governance
- Wide network of scientific advisors
- Widespread public support

### 4. "Living Biobank" Concept Alignment

The emerging literature supports Suite 2's Living Biorepository concept:

**From traditional to living:**
- Most biobanks remain "Emerging—rich in samples but poor in synthesis"
- Next-generation biobanks must integrate "end-to-end into a continuously learning ecosystem"
- With proper computational layer, biobanks can become "strategic partners in target discovery, trial design, and population-level risk modelling"

**EHR Linkage Benefits:**
- Enables cost-effective longitudinal studies
- Theoretically lifetime-duration clinical trials observing outcomes through EHRs
- Saves labour and improves data reliability

## Strategic Options for CFI Proposal

### Option A: Expand Existing Suite 2 with IsletCore-Like Specialty Biobanks

**Concept:** Create specialized "cores within the core" for specific sample types, modelled on IsletCore success.

**Potential specialty cores:**
1. **MS/Neuro-Immunology Core** - CSF, PBMCs from MS patients (aligns with MS Cell Therapies flagship)
2. **Rare Disease Core** - Specialized samples from RareKids Network
3. **Vaccine Response Core** - Serial samples from vaccine trials (PRAIRIE Hub integration)
4. **Cell Therapy Products Core** - ACTM-manufactured products with outcome tracking

**Advantages:**
- Leverages proven IsletCore model
- Creates focused expertise for each sample type
- Enables international distribution and collaboration

### Option B: National "Living Biobank" Network Node

**Concept:** Position Suite 2 as a node in a national living biobank network, with real-time data linkage as the differentiator.

**Implementation:**
- Connect with CTRNet for certification and standards
- Develop FHIR-based linkage as model for national adoption
- Share BioBank software enhancements nationally
- Pursue CBRF/BRIF supplemental funding for network expansion

**Advantages:**
- Aligns with CFI emphasis on national impact
- Builds on existing CBSR national presence
- Creates collaborative rather than competitive positioning

### Option C: Disease-Specific Biobank Initiatives

**Concept:** Develop new biobank initiatives around flagship programs.

**Potential initiatives:**
1. **Alberta MS Biobank** - Longitudinal biospecimens linked to Connect Care outcomes
2. **Pediatric Rare Disease Biobank** - National resource for ultra-rare conditions
3. **Alberta Vaccine Response Biobank** - Challenge trial samples with outcome annotation

**Advantages:**
- Creates distinct funding opportunities
- Enables disease-specific international collaborations
- Builds research community around specific conditions

### Option D: Integration with Existing Provincial Assets

**Concept:** Demonstrate how Suite 2 enhances existing Alberta biobanking investments.

**Existing assets to integrate:**
1. **IsletCore** - Add outcome annotation capabilities via Suite 4 integration
2. **APL Biobank** - Enhance with real-time EMR linkage
3. **CBSR (existing)** - Upgrade to Living Biorepository capabilities
4. **Alberta Health Services Biobanks** - Connect via provincial data governance

**Advantages:**
- Shows stewardship of prior investments
- Creates comprehensive provincial ecosystem
- Addresses CFI concern about duplication

## Recommended Actions

1. **Acknowledge IsletCore as proof-of-concept** for specialty core facilities in Alberta
2. **Consider explicit collaboration** with ADI for outcome annotation pilot
3. **Strengthen CTRNet alignment** in certification and quality standards
4. **Emphasize UK Biobank lessons** for Living Biorepository positioning
5. **Identify 2-3 specific new use cases** for biobank integration (e.g., MS biobank, vaccine response biobank)
