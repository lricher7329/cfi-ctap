# Budget Alignment: Verify Equipment Lines Are Infrastructure, Not Operating Costs

## Source
CFI-CTAP Grant Proposal Review (Antigravity Agent, January 2026)

## Priority
HIGH

## Context
Reviewer advises: "Verify that the budget lines in the Google Sheet strictly feel like infrastructure—avoiding operating costs masquerading as capital."

## Recommendation
Review all budget lines to ensure CFI eligibility:
- CFI funds equipment, not operations
- Software licenses must be perpetual or capital in nature
- Personnel costs are NOT CFI-eligible
- Training costs are NOT CFI-eligible

## Actions Required
1. **Review Equipment CSV** (`_data/equipment.csv`) for red flags:
   - Annual subscription fees (ineligible)
   - Personnel costs embedded in equipment lines
   - Vague descriptions that could be interpreted as operations

2. **Common Issues to Check**:
   - [ ] OpenSpecimen: Is this perpetual license or annual? Must be capital
   - [ ] AWS costs: Are these infrastructure (eligible) or operating (ineligible)?
   - [ ] SDRE allocations: How framed?
   - [ ] Training equipment vs. training programs
   - [ ] Consultation fees embedded in equipment

3. **Reframe if Needed**:
   - "Software as a Service" → "Perpetual software license + hardware"
   - "Annual fees" → Remove or shift to IOF (Infrastructure Operating Fund)
   - "Personnel" → Move to matching funds, not CFI request

4. **Budget Narrative Alignment**:
   - Ensure budget justification describes equipment, not activities
   - "Purchase of X equipment" not "Funding for X program"

## Example Fixes
**Before (problematic):**
> "OpenSpecimen LIMS implementation: $45,000 (includes first year license and training)"

**After (CFI-eligible):**
> "OpenSpecimen LIMS perpetual enterprise license: $30,000"
> "(Note: Annual maintenance and training covered by IOF)"
