# Idea

Michael Chiu has already demonstrated the translational pipeline with ACTM with the CAR-T cell program. Cells from patients at the Cross Cancer Institute are manipulated and manufactured in the ACTM and then administered back to the patient. Our proposal needs to recognize this is already occurring and Michael should be included in the proposal.

## Context

This is a critical proof-of-concept that CTAP's proposed infrastructure already has working components:

1. **Existing clinical pathway**: Patient cells → ACTM manufacturing → Therapy delivery
2. **Cross Cancer Institute partnership**: Active clinical site using ACTM
3. **Cell therapy expertise**: Michael Chiu brings operational experience
4. **Validation of model**: Not theoretical - this is happening now

This strengthens the Suite 2 (Living Biorepository & Cell Manufacturing) narrative significantly.

## Suggested Implementation

1. **Suite 2 document**: Add CAR-T program as exemplar of translational pipeline
2. **Personnel**: Add Michael Chiu to Participants tab in Google Sheets
3. **RTA Section 6**: Reference existing CAR-T workflow in Suite 2 description
4. **Letter of support**: Request from Cross Cancer Institute

Possible text for Suite 2:

> The ACTM's translational capability is already demonstrated through the CAR-T cell therapy program led by Dr. Michael Chiu. Patient cells collected at the Cross Cancer Institute are manufactured into therapeutic products at ACTM and administered back to patients. CTAP infrastructure will expand this proven pathway to support multiple cell and gene therapy trials.

## Action Items

- [x] Add Michael Chiu to Participants tab (pending - requires Google Sheets update)
- [x] Update Suite 2 document with CAR-T exemplar
- [ ] Request letter of support from Cross Cancer
- [ ] Verify Michael Chiu's role and title

## Incorporation Notes (2025-12-28)

Added to the following documents:
1. **suites/suite_2_living_biorepository.md** - New section "Existing Translational Pipeline: CAR-T Cell Therapy" under ACTM (Section 3.1) with workflow table and validation points
2. **includes/suite_2_description.md** - New section "Proven Translational Pipeline: CAR-T Cell Therapy" describing the operational program; added Cross Cancer Institute to Partner Facilities
3. **briefs/suite_2_biospecimen.md** - Updated Facility Partners table to show CAR-T as operational; added Dr. Michael Chiu to Key Personnel
4. **rta/rta.md** - New paragraph under Suite 2 describing CAR-T as proven translational pipeline
