# Idea

AI Scribe is a clinical scribe tool being tested in the emergency department. Dr. Ross Mitchell is the creator of AI Scribe and there have been multiple online articles. The idea is that AI Scribe could be integrated in an AI-first clinical trial workflow for data collection, and potentially even the consent process.

## Context

### AI Scribe Overview

**AI Scribe** (now dubbed "Jenkins") is an AI-powered clinical documentation tool developed by Dr. Ross Mitchell, Professor in the Division of General Internal Medicine at the University of Alberta and Amii Fellow/Canada CIFAR AI Chair.

**How it works:**
- Uses large language models (similar to ChatGPT) to transcribe and summarize doctor-patient conversations
- Simple interface runs on phone or computer
- Generates notes including: history of presenting illness, past medical history, medications, physical exam results, diagnosis, and treatment plan
- Physician reviews for accuracy before signing off and adding to patient chart

**Key features:**
- **Local data security**: All data stays within Alberta - "not a single byte travels outside the province" - same security level as banking and military sectors
- **Open-source platform**: Being made available for both commercial and research use

### Current Deployment Status (as of May 2025)

- Piloted in 3 Alberta emergency departments: Red Deer Regional, Royal Alexandra, and University of Alberta hospitals
- Since November 2024: 6,700+ clinical sessions by 58 physicians across 10 Alberta emergency facilities
- Processed 7,500+ conversations and 1,000+ hours of audio
- Expanding to 850+ emergency physicians across Edmonton, Calgary, and Red Deer

### Demonstrated Impact

- **~3 additional patients seen per physician per shift** due to time savings
- Improved face-to-face patient interactions and eye contact (less computer screen time)
- Physicians report they "will never go back to doing manual notes"

### Funding

- $1M from The Health Care Unburdened Grant Program (Canadian Medical Association, MD Financial Management Inc., Scotiabank)

## CFI CTAP Integration Opportunities

### 1. Clinical Trial Data Collection (Suite 4 & 5)
- AI Scribe could capture clinical trial visit data automatically
- Structured data extraction from conversations could populate REDCap/EDC systems
- Real-time clinical assessment documentation during trial visits
- Integration with OMOP CDM for standardized clinical observations

### 2. Electronic Consent Process
- AI-assisted consent conversations with automatic documentation
- Transcript generation for consent process audit trails
- Comprehension checking and question documentation
- Multi-language support potential

### 3. AI-First Trial Workflow Components
- Voice-first data entry reducing clinician burden
- Automated adverse event capture from clinical conversations
- Patient-reported outcome collection via conversation
- Real-time quality checks and missing data identification

### 4. TRE/Data Platform Integration (Suite 4)
- Local processing aligns with Alberta data sovereignty requirements
- Integration with planned AWS TRE infrastructure
- De-identification pipeline for research data extraction
- NIST CSF 2.0 compliant security architecture

### 5. Decentralized Trial Support (Suite 5)
- Remote monitoring conversations with automatic documentation
- Home visit documentation for decentralized trials
- Telehealth trial visit capture

## Research Required

1. **Literature search**: AI scribes in clinical trials, voice-based EDC, automated consent documentation
2. **Technical assessment**: Integration APIs, data formats, OMOP mapping
3. **Regulatory considerations**: GCP compliance for AI-generated source documentation
4. **Pilot design**: Feasibility study within existing trial infrastructure

## Suggested Implementation

1. **Immediate**: Add AI Scribe as exemplar use case in Suite 4/5 narrative demonstrating AI-first clinical trials
2. **Short-term**: Identify Dr. Ross Mitchell as potential collaborator/co-applicant
3. **Medium-term**: Design pilot integration study for AI Scribe in clinical trial workflow
4. **Long-term**: Build AI Scribe integration into CTAP data infrastructure architecture
