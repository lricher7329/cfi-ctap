# Idea

Integrate AI drug discovery ecosystem concepts from research synthesis, including single-cell spatial analysis equipment, Faculty of Pharmacy drug discovery team, 48Hour Discovery partnership, and Clinical-QSP Loop architecture.

## Key Additions

1. **Suite 3 Single-Cell Stack** (+$1.5M):
   - 10x Genomics Xenium (spatial transcriptomics) - $650,000
   - IsoPlexis IsoLight (functional proteomics) - $450,000
   - PhenomeX Beacon (optofluidic cell selection) - $400,000

2. **Drug Discovery Team** (Faculty of Pharmacy + Chemistry):
   - Dr. Ratmir Derda (48Hour Discovery phage display platform)
   - Dr. Khaled Barakat (computational drug discovery, HEKA/ACHLYS spinoffs)
   - Dr. Amir Tabatabaei Dakhili (AI-driven drug design, SCOT inhibitors)
   - Dr. John Ussher (CRC, metabolic therapeutics, drug repurposing)

3. **Cross-Bar Switch Narrative**: Integration story connecting Amii, TMIC, GlycoNet, API

4. **Clinical-QSP Loop**: Connect Care → API QSP models → Living Digital Twin

5. **NVIDIA BioNeMo**: Specified in GPU compute cluster for drug discovery AI
