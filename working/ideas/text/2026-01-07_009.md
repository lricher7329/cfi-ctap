# In Silico Agent: Ground the "Digital Twin" with Data Volume Requirements

## Source
CFI-CTAP Grant Proposal Review (Antigravity Agent, January 2026)

## Priority
MEDIUM

## Context
Reviewer notes the In Silico Assessment Agent is a "moonshot" goal that justifies CFI investment, but needs grounding to avoid sounding like "sci-fi."

## Recommendation
1. For the "In Silico Agent," clarify the data volume required
2. This justifies the interdependence between Suites

## Actions Required
1. **Specify Data Requirements**:
   > "The In Silico Assessment Agent requires training on large-scale historical trial data. Suite 2's biorepository (target: 100,000 linked samples), combined with Suite 4's Connect Care integration (4.4M patient records, 5+ years longitudinal depth), provides the data volume necessary for population-level effect prediction."

2. **Add Validation Pathway**:
   - Retrospective validation: "Run" historical trials in silico, compare to actual outcomes
   - Prospective validation: Generate predictions before enrollment, validate as trial progresses
   - Benchmark against GEMINI Chartwatch validation methodology

3. **Emphasize Feasibility Anchors**:
   - Reference Lazar Atanackovic's Meta Flow Matching work (established methodology)
   - Reference GEMINI Chartwatch as proof that integrated data + AI can improve outcomes
   - Reference QSP models as established precedent for in silico prediction

4. **Mock Review Recommendation**: The reviewer suggests running the In Silico section by a skeptic—consider internal review by non-AI investigators before submission.

## Suggested Text
> **In Silico Assessment Agent: From Moonshot to Milestone**
>
> The In Silico Assessment Agent represents CTAP's highest-ambition capability—the ability to "stress test" proposed trials before recruiting a single patient. This is not science fiction but an engineering challenge with clear requirements:
>
> - **Data Foundation**: Suite 2's linked biorepository (100,000 samples) combined with Suite 4's Connect Care integration (4.4M records, 5+ years depth) provides the statistical power for effect prediction
> - **Methodological Anchor**: Dr. Atanackovic's Meta Flow Matching framework provides the generative AI architecture, extended here to clinical prediction
> - **Validation Strategy**: Retrospective validation using CVC's completed trial archive (50+ trials) allows testing predictions against known outcomes before prospective deployment
>
> Conservative deployment timeline: Year 3-4 after validation against historical trial data.
