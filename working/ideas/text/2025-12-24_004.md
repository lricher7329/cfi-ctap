# Idea

Developing a concept challenge trial unit I do not think has been fully fleshed out with a thorough web search and requirements identification. This component of the clinical trial infrastructure is critical to the vaccine program and should include Michael Houghton's work as a Nobel laureate.

## Status: IMPLEMENTED

This idea has been researched and implemented. See changes below.

## Research Conducted

Comprehensive web research was performed on:

1. **International Challenge Trial Facilities**
   - hVIVO (UK/Germany): 150+ beds, BSL-3 certified, world's largest commercial operator
   - Imperial College London: Led world's first COVID-19 challenge study (2021)
   - Royal Free Hospital: Specialist secure containment unit
   - Chelsea & Westminster Hospital: Ron Johnson Ward quarantine unit

2. **Facility Design Requirements**
   - Negative pressure: -25 to -30 Pa (10x CDC minimum)
   - Air changes: ≥10-12 ACH with HEPA filtration
   - Room configuration: En-suite bathroom, airlock entry, interlocking doors
   - Monitoring: 24/7 medical staff, telemetry, video surveillance
   - Quarantine duration: 14+ days typical, PCR-negative discharge

3. **Regulatory Pathway**
   - Health Canada: Standard CTA process (no specific CHIM guidance)
   - WHO Guidance: TRS 1004, Annex 10
   - ICH E6(R2) Good Clinical Practice
   - Pre-submission meeting recommended for novel protocols

4. **Canada's Gap**
   - NO dedicated challenge trial facilities exist in Canada
   - CTAP would establish Canada's first academic capability

## Implementation Completed

### Suite 1 Document Updates
- Added Section 1.5: Vaccine Challenge Trial Unit ($490,000)
- Added extensive Section 2: Challenge Trial Unit Background & Rationale
  - 2.1 What are Human Challenge Trials?
  - 2.2 International Exemplars and Standards
  - 2.3 Facility Design Requirements
  - 2.4 Regulatory Pathway
  - 2.5 Michael Houghton and Li Ka Shing Institute Integration
  - 2.6 Strategic Value
- Updated budget from $1,700,000 to $2,190,000

### Google Sheets Updates
- Added 4 equipment items to Equipment tab (IDs 38-41)
- Updated Michael Houghton entry in Participants tab with full credentials

### RTA Updates
- Enhanced Hepatitis C and Vaccine Trials flagship program section
- Added Michael Houghton (Nobel laureate 2020) as program lead
- Added Challenge Trial Unit as key capability

### Brief and Include Updates
- Updated Suite 1 brief with challenge trial capability
