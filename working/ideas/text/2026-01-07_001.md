# Suite 3: Reframe Gap-Filling Equipment as High-Throughput Clinical Instrumentation

## Source
CFI-CTAP Grant Proposal Review (Antigravity Agent, January 2026)

## Priority
HIGH

## Context
Suite 3 is identified as the "weakest link" in the proposal. The reviewer notes:
- "Gap-filling equipment reserve" is vague
- CFI buys things, not capabilities in the abstract
- Current framing sounds like "coordination funding" (ineligible) rather than "infrastructure capability" (eligible)

## Recommendation
Identify specific bottlenecks at partner facilities that prevent clinical trial speed (vs discovery speed).

**Example language from review:**
> "Current mass specs at TMIC are optimized for deep discovery (24h/sample). CTAP requires 'high-throughput clinical mode' systems (15min/sample) to return data to patients in relevant timeframes."

## Actions Required
1. **Facility Consultations**: Meet with ACE Core, TMIC, GlycoNet, APM, Cryo-EM directors to identify specific throughput bottlenecks for clinical trial timelines
2. **Equipment Specification**: For each bottleneck, identify specific instrument/configuration that addresses clinical trial turnaround requirements
3. **Reframe Budget**: Convert $500K "gap-filling reserve" to named equipment with specifications
4. **Turnaround Time Metrics**: For each item, specify:
   - Current discovery-mode throughput (samples/day)
   - Required clinical-mode throughput
   - Specific equipment that bridges gap

## Example Reframe
**Before (vague):**
> Gap-Filling Equipment Reserve: $500,000 reserved for targeted equipment purchases identified through facility engagement

**After (specific):**
> High-Throughput Clinical Proteomics System: $350,000
> - Current APM capacity: 20 samples/week (discovery mode)
> - Clinical trial requirement: 50 samples/day for real-time biomarker feedback
> - Equipment: Bruker timsTOF HT with clinical batch automation
> - Enables: Same-day PD biomarker results for dose-response trials
