# MASTER.md: Add AI Regulation Risk Section with TRE as Safety Mechanism

## Source
CFI-CTAP Grant Proposal Review (Antigravity Agent, January 2026)

## Priority
HIGH

## Context
Reviewer recommends acknowledging AI regulatory risk and positioning Suite 4 as the safety mechanism.

## Recommendation
Add a section on "AI Regulation Risk." Acknowledge that AI in health is high-risk and point to the "Sandboxing" capabilities of Suite 4 as the safety mechanism that allows Canada to regulate effectively.

## Actions Required
1. **Add to §8.3 Risk Registry** (Strategic Risks):

   | Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
   |------|------------|--------|------------|
   | AI regulatory restrictions | Medium | High | TRE sandboxing; human-in-the-loop mandatory; audit trails |

2. **Add "AI Regulatory Environment" subsection** to §2.4 (Why This Approach) or §8 (Feasibility and Risk):

   > **Navigating AI Regulatory Evolution**
   >
   > The regulatory landscape for AI in healthcare is evolving rapidly. Health Canada's "Good Machine Learning Practice" guidance (2021) and anticipated AI-specific regulations will require infrastructure capable of:
   >
   > - **Algorithm Auditing**: Tracking which AI models were used, on what data, with what parameters
   > - **Explainability**: Documenting the reasoning chain for AI-assisted decisions
   > - **Performance Monitoring**: Detecting model drift and bias emergence over time
   > - **Sandboxed Development**: Testing new AI capabilities without risking patient safety
   >
   > **Suite 4 as Regulatory Enabler:**
   >
   > The Three-Zone TRE architecture is designed for regulatory compliance by construction:
   > - **Zone 2 (Controlled Processing)**: All AI agent operations logged with full audit trails
   > - **Output Airlocks**: Every AI-generated output reviewed before researcher access
   > - **Model Registry**: Version control for all deployed CRAIDL agents
   > - **Sandbox Environments**: New agent versions tested in isolated environments before production deployment
   >
   > This architecture transforms regulatory compliance from burden to capability—allowing Canada to confidently deploy AI in clinical trials while maintaining the oversight that public trust requires.
