# Idea

Identify and name specific individuals for Suite 2 key personnel roles currently listed by title only.

## Context

The Suite 2 brief (lines 128-136) lists several key personnel by role but without named individuals:

| Role | Current Status |
|------|----------------|
| CBSR Operations Lead | **Unnamed** |
| ACTM Manufacturing Lead | **Unnamed** |
| Data Linkage Specialist | **Unnamed** |
| Quality Assurance Manager | **Unnamed** |
| AI/ML Engineer | **Unnamed** |
| Biobank Technicians | **Unnamed** |

Only Dr. Michael Chiu (Cross Cancer) is named in the brief.

The technical spec (Section 10) has similar gaps:
- Biobank Operations Lead (1.0 FTE) - unnamed
- Lab Manager (1.0 FTE) - unnamed
- Cell Manufacturing Lead (1.0 FTE) - unnamed
- Quality Manager (0.5 FTE) - unnamed
- IT Specialist (0.5 FTE) - unnamed

## Impact

CFI applications benefit from named personnel demonstrating:
1. Existing expertise and capacity
2. Institutional commitment
3. Clear accountability for deliverables

## Suggested Implementation

1. Contact CBSR leadership for Operations Lead and Lab Manager names
2. Contact ACTM for Cell Manufacturing Lead name
3. Determine if named individuals exist or if roles require hiring post-award
4. For roles requiring new hires, indicate "To be recruited" with hiring plan
5. Update both brief and technical spec with consistent personnel information
