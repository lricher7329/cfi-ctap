# Idea

Need to make a stronger link between the synthetic control arm and rare or uncommon diseases (rare = < 5 per 10,000 population)

## Context

The synthetic control arm (SCA) capability is already documented in Suite 4, but the connection to rare disease trials could be strengthened. SCAs are particularly valuable for rare diseases where:

1. **Traditional RCTs are impractical** - Insufficient patient numbers for randomized control groups
2. **Ethical concerns** - Withholding treatment from control arms when disease is serious/progressive
3. **Regulatory precedent** - FDA and Health Canada increasingly accept external/synthetic controls for rare disease indications

The EU definition of rare disease is <5 per 10,000 population. Alberta's 4.4M population enables identification of even ultra-rare conditions.

## Suggested Implementation

1. **Add rare disease context to SCA section** in `suites/suite_4_data_platform.md`:
   - Reference EU/FDA definitions (<5 per 10,000)
   - Cite regulatory acceptance of external controls
   - Connect to CTAP's rare disease unit in Suite 1

2. **Link to RareKids-CAN** - Already listed as a federation partner; strengthen the connection between SCA methodology and pediatric rare disease trials

3. **Quantify opportunity**:
   - Alberta's population enables identification of diseases with prevalence as low as ~440 patients (1 per 10,000)
   - Connect Care's longitudinal depth provides natural history data for counterfactual construction

4. **Reference regulatory guidance**:
   - FDA Guidance on Natural History Studies for Drug Development (2019)
   - EMA Guideline on registry-based studies (2021)
   - Health Canada guidance on RWE for regulatory decisions
