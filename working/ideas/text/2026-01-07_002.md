# Suite 1: Explicitly Link Physical Units to AI Backbone

## Source
CFI-CTAP Grant Proposal Review (Antigravity Agent, January 2026)

## Priority
HIGH

## Context
Reviewer notes Suite 1 is "Strong" with concrete equipment requests, but recommends strengthening the physical-digital integration narrative.

## Recommendation
Make the physical infrastructure explicitly dependent on the digital (Suite 4/5).

**Example language from review:**
> "The Vaccine Challenge Unit is not just a room; it is a sensor-rich environment where Suite 5 wearables feed real-time toxicity data to Suite 4's Safety Agent."

## Actions Required
1. **Challenge Trial Unit**: Add language showing sensor integration
   - Real-time physiological monitoring → Suite 5 wearables
   - Symptom capture → AI Scribe integration
   - Safety signal detection → Events Agent (CRAIDL)

2. **Autonomic Function Labs**:
   - Tilt table data → Suite 4 TRE for pattern recognition
   - QSART/Finapres → Digital biomarker extraction
   - Longitudinal outcome linkage to Connect Care

3. **Rare Disease Trials Unit**:
   - Genomic characterization → Suite 3 omics pipeline
   - Natural history data → CRAIDL Protocol Agent training

4. **Each Unit Should Include**:
   - Data flows to Suite 4 TRE
   - AI agent touchpoints
   - Suite 5 device integration opportunities

## Suggested Text Addition
For each physical unit description, add a "Digital Integration" subsection:

> **Digital Integration:** The Vaccine Challenge Unit functions as a sensor-rich clinical environment. Continuous physiological monitoring (heart rate, temperature, SpO2) streams to Suite 4's TRE, where the Events Agent monitors for predefined safety thresholds. Participant symptom diaries are captured via Suite 5's mobile app and transcribed by AI Scribe for automated adverse event coding. This integration transforms a controlled infection study into a living data asset for CRAIDL training.
