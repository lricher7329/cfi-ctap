# Idea

Integrate the UAlberta AWS TRE Assessment document into Suite 4 (Data Platform) documentation. The TRE Assessment provides a comprehensive architectural framework that should be explicitly referenced and incorporated into the CTAP data infrastructure narrative.

## Key Content to Integrate

### 1. Three-Zone Architecture

The TRE follows a three-zone model aligned with Alberta Health Information Act (HIA):

| Zone | Function | CTAP Application |
|------|----------|------------------|
| **Zone 1: Identifiable** | Custodian-controlled, identifiable health data | Connect Care feeds, BioBank primary data |
| **Zone 2: Controlled** | De-identification, linkage processing | OMOP transformation, sample-phenotype linkage |
| **Zone 3: Research** | De-identified analytics environment | Researcher workspaces, AI/ML models |

### 2. Core Use Cases Already Defined

The TRE Assessment identifies four use cases directly relevant to CTAP:

1. **Translational Multi-Omics Research**
   - Linking clinical phenotypes with genomics, proteomics, metabolomics, glycomics
   - S3-backed data lake with hybrid cloud + on-prem GPU compute

2. **Biobank and Biosample Linkage**
   - Physical samples remain on-premise; metadata in secure environment
   - Consent-based access workflows
   - Cross-study reuse without data duplication

3. **Clinical Trial Feasibility and Recruitment**
   - Near-real-time cohort discovery
   - OMOP-based cohort definitions
   - Aggregate counts for feasibility analytics

4. **Federated Analytics (VITAL/OMOP)**
   - Alberta as node in federated networks
   - Local query execution, aggregate result sharing
   - Alignment with GEMINI approach

### 3. International Comparators

The assessment positions UAlberta TRE against global leaders:

| Platform | Key Feature | UAlberta Parallel |
|----------|-------------|-------------------|
| **UK Biobank RAP** | "Bring researchers to data" | Same model |
| **All of Us** | OMOP CDM, tiered access, cohort builder | Same approach |
| **FinnGen** | National registry linkage, no raw export | HIA alignment |
| **Genomics England** | WGS + NHS records, airlock outputs | Custodian partnership |

### 4. Snowflake vs TRE Complementarity

| Dimension | Snowflake | AWS TRE |
|-----------|-----------|---------|
| Primary role | Data sharing, SQL analytics | Full research compute |
| Compute | SQL / limited Python | Arbitrary compute, GPUs |
| Data types | Structured | Structured + unstructured |
| Best use | Standardized analytics | Discovery, AI, pipelines |

**Key message**: Snowflake complements but does not replace TRE. Suite 4 should describe both components.

### 5. Identified Gaps (CTAP Opportunity)

The TRE Assessment identifies gaps that CTAP investments can address:

| Gap | CTAP Response |
|-----|---------------|
| Formalized access and governance committees | CRAIDL governance structure |
| Project-level isolation and cost attribution | Per-project workspaces |
| Real-time / streaming data patterns | Wearable data ingestion (Suite 5) |
| Metadata catalog and dataset discoverability | OMOP-based catalog |
| Long-term sustainability funding model | CFI operations funding |

## Suggested Suite 4 Revisions

### 1. Add TRE Architecture Section

Include the three-zone diagram and explain alignment with HIA:

```markdown
## AWS Trusted Research Environment

CTAP's data infrastructure leverages the University of Alberta's AWS Trusted Research Environment (TRE),
a three-zone architecture designed for HIA compliance:

![AWS TRE Architecture](../background/aws_tre_diagram.png)

- **Zone 1 (Identifiable)**: Custodian-controlled data (Connect Care, BioBank)
- **Zone 2 (Controlled)**: De-identification and linkage processing
- **Zone 3 (Research)**: Researcher access to de-identified datasets
```

### 2. Position Against International Exemplars

Reference UK Biobank, All of Us, FinnGen to demonstrate alignment with global best practices.

### 3. Clarify Snowflake Role

Explain that Snowflake handles standardized analytics while TRE enables discovery, AI, and flexible compute.

### 4. Address Gaps as CTAP Value

Frame CTAP investments as addressing TRE gaps:
- Governance formalization
- Project isolation
- Streaming data capability
- Metadata discoverability
- Sustainability model
