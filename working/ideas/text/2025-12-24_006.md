# Idea

The adult and pediatric CIU that are currently in operation need to be better represented in the Suite 1 plan. Their current equipment lists and capabilities are outlined at https://nactrc.ca/about/clinical-investigations-unit/. Please review the documentation on these two existing facilities and plan how to incorporate in the Suite 1 plan. Some of the planned equipment may already be available, but upgrades may still be required. I also wonder if the challenge unit can be incorporated in the adult CIU or not. Both of these CIU are located in the hospital and I am unclear if a challenge facility could be located in a hospital.

## Challenge Trial Unit: Hospital Location Feasibility

### Key Question

Can a Vaccine Challenge Trial Unit (CHIM facility) be located within a hospital like the Adult CIU at UAH?

### Research Findings

#### International Precedent: Hospital-Based Challenge Facilities

| Facility | Location Type | Notes |
|----------|---------------|-------|
| **Royal Free Hospital, London** | NHS Hospital | COVID-19 challenge studies conducted in "specialist and secure clinical research facilities" within the hospital |
| **Imperial College London** | NHS Hospitals | Uses Hammersmith Hospital (outpatient) and Chelsea & Westminster Hospital (inpatient) |
| **hVivo Whitechapel** | Standalone quarantine clinic | Former boutique hotel converted; NOT hospital-based |
| **hVivo QMB** | Standalone | Queen Mary BioEnterprise Innovation Centre; 24-31 beds |
| **hVivo Canary Wharf (new)** | Standalone purpose-built | 50-70 bed capacity; opened 2024 |

**Sources:**
- [Royal Free Hospital COVID-19 Challenge](https://www.royalfree.nhs.uk/news/worlds-first-covid-19-human-challenge-study-could-unlock-new-treatments)
- [Imperial College Human Challenge Studies](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/medicine/departments/infectious-disease/research/human-challenge/)
- [hVivo Canary Wharf Announcement](https://www.sharecast.com/news/aim-bulletin/hvivo-announces-new-canary-wharf-trial-facility--14532684.html)

#### Key Insight: Two Models Exist

1. **Hospital-Based Model** (Royal Free, Imperial)
   - Leverages existing clinical infrastructure
   - Access to emergency response teams
   - Shares resources with hospital
   - Requires dedicated isolation rooms with appropriate air handling
   - Used for higher-risk pathogens requiring hospital proximity

2. **Standalone Quarantine Model** (hVivo)
   - Purpose-built quarantine facilities
   - Often converted hotels or dedicated buildings
   - Complete isolation from general public
   - More suitable for extended quarantine (14+ days)
   - Used for influenza, RSV, rhinovirus challenge studies

#### Adult CIU Suitability for Challenge Trials

| Requirement | Adult CIU Current | Gap | Recommendation |
|-------------|-------------------|-----|----------------|
| **Negative pressure (-25 Pa)** | Not available | Critical gap | NOT suitable for airborne pathogens without major renovation |
| **HEPA filtration (≥12 ACH)** | Not specified | Critical gap | Would require HVAC upgrade |
| **En-suite facilities** | Two 4-bed wards | Not private | Challenge requires single-occupancy isolation |
| **Airlock entry** | Not available | Critical gap | Major renovation required |
| **Quarantine capability** | Overnight possible | Limited | 14+ day quarantine not designed for |
| **BSL-2+ containment** | Class 2 Bio Safety Hood | Partial | Level 2 virus compliance already certified |
| **Hospital emergency access** | Yes (MET, code team) | Strength | Major advantage for safety |

### Recommendation: Challenge Trial Unit Location

**Conclusion: The Challenge Trial Unit should NOT be integrated into the existing Adult CIU.**

**Rationale:**

1. **Physical Infrastructure**: The Adult CIU has two 4-bed ward rooms, not single-occupancy isolation rooms with en-suite facilities. Challenge trials require 14+ days of individual quarantine with airlock entry and negative pressure.

2. **HVAC Requirements**: Challenge trials require -25 Pa negative pressure and ≥12 air changes per hour with HEPA filtration. Retrofitting this into an existing hospital ward would be extremely costly and disruptive.

3. **Quarantine Function**: Challenge participants must be isolated for 14+ days to prevent community transmission. The Adult CIU is designed for day procedures and short-stay monitoring, not extended residential quarantine.

4. **International Model**: While the Royal Free Hospital in London does conduct challenge studies, they use "specialist and secure clinical research facilities" that were purpose-designed for containment. hVivo's expansion to purpose-built standalone facilities (Canary Wharf) suggests hospital integration has limitations.

**Recommended Approach:**

| Option | Description | Pros | Cons |
|--------|-------------|------|------|
| **A: Kipnes Precinct (New Build)** | Purpose-built Challenge Unit in new Kipnes Health Research Academy | Optimal design; proximity to research facilities | Higher cost; depends on Kipnes timeline |
| **B: UAH Renovated Wing** | Convert underutilized hospital space to isolation unit | Hospital proximity for safety; uses existing infrastructure | Major renovation; hospital disruption |
| **C: Hybrid with Royal Free Model** | Partner with Li Ka Shing Institute for purpose-built unit near UAH | Dedicated facility; Houghton program alignment | Separate governance |

## Suggested Implementation for Suite 1

### 1. Acknowledge Existing CIU Infrastructure

Suite 1 document should recognize that NACTRC operates two established Clinical Investigation Units:
- **Adult CIU**: 8-bed unit with Phase I-IV capability, Level 2 containment
- **Pediatric CIU**: Phase I authorization with research nursing expertise

### 2. Frame CTAP as Upgrade/Enhancement

Rather than building new CIU infrastructure, CTAP investments should be framed as:
- **Upgrading** aging equipment (2005-era monitors in Adult CIU)
- **Enhancing** POC laboratory capability (gap in both CIUs)
- **Expanding** IP pharmacy automation (gap)
- **Adding** specialized capability (rare disease, challenge trials)

### 3. Revise Budget Allocations

| Category | Original | Revised | Notes |
|----------|----------|---------|-------|
| Monitoring equipment | $385,000 | ~$250,000 | Existing monitors may only need partial replacement |
| POC laboratory | $265,000 | $265,000 | Full investment (gap in existing CIUs) |
| IP pharmacy | $300,000 | $250,000 | Partial gap; some infrastructure exists |
| Renovation/fit-out | $750,000 | $600,000 | Scope may be reduced given existing facilities |
| Challenge Trial Unit | $490,000 | $490,000 | Full investment (new capability) |
| Pediatric Rare Disease | $200,000 | $200,000 | Full investment (new equipment) |

**Potential Savings: ~$150,000-$200,000** that could be reallocated.

### 4. Separate Challenge Trial Unit

The Challenge Trial Unit should be:
- **Separate from existing Adult CIU** (different infrastructure requirements)
- **Located in Kipnes precinct** (new construction) OR **dedicated renovation** (not within existing CIU footprint)
- **Connected to hospital** for emergency support but with independent air handling and quarantine capability

### 5. Strengthen Pediatric CIU Description

The Pediatric CIU section should:
- Acknowledge existing Phase I authorization and NACTRC partnership
- Describe CTAP as **equipment investment** into existing space
- Emphasize Stollery Foundation contribution for family-friendly spaces
- Connect to RareKids-CAN network and Translational Genomics Hub

## Proposed Actions

1. **Equipment Audit**: Conduct formal inventory of Adult and Pediatric CIU equipment to identify exact replacement/upgrade needs
2. **Revise Suite 1 Narrative**: Frame CTAP as enhancement of existing NACTRC infrastructure, not de novo construction
3. **Challenge Unit Siting Decision**: Confirm location strategy with Kipnes planning team and Li Ka Shing Institute leadership
4. **Budget Reallocation**: Redirect any savings to priority gaps (POC laboratory, automated dispensing)
5. **NACTRC Partnership MOU**: Formalize relationship for equipment procurement and operations
