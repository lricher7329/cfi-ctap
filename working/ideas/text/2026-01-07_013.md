# Idea

Strengthen the In Silico Assessment Agent as a differentiating outcome in the grant application. Add feasibility statements and implementation ideas, noting that population-level analysis will only be done "behind the firewall" in the AHS data warehouse or Snowflake. Consider how CTAP can still leverage the TRE and other infrastructure.

## Context

The In Silico Assessment Agent is described in `background/data-innovations/in-silico-control-arm.md` as CTAP's "highest-ambition capability" - a prospective trial intelligence layer that stress-tests protocols before patient enrollment. This is distinct from Synthetic Control Arms (retrospective counterfactuals).

**Current gap**: The RTA and suite descriptions underplay this capability relative to its strategic value. The agent is listed in the CRAIDL table at TRL 3 (research prototype) but the transformative potential is not fully articulated.

**Key constraint**: Population-scale EMR analysis at the 4.4M patient level must occur within AHS's governance perimeter (behind the firewall). This creates an architectural question about TRE integration.

## Suggested Implementation

### 1. Clarify the "Behind the Firewall" Architecture

The In Silico Agent operates in a **federated model**:

```
AHS Data Warehouse (Snowflake)          |  CTAP TRE
─────────────────────────────────────────┼─────────────────────────────
- 4.4M patient records                   |  Zone 3: Research Environment
- Raw eligibility queries                |  - Agent development
- Population-scale feasibility runs      |  - Model training (on aggregates)
- Returns: aggregate statistics only     |  - Protocol optimization UI
                                         |
- AHS-managed, behind firewall           |  - CTAP-managed, researcher access
- No researcher access to raw data       |  - Works with outputs, not inputs
```

**Key insight**: The agent doesn't need patient-level data to train or operate. It needs:
- Aggregate eligibility counts
- Population-level distributions (age, comorbidity, event rates)
- Outcome trajectories (anonymized or synthetic)
- Recruitment pattern summaries

These can be extracted from AHS/Snowflake as **pre-computed analytical products** that flow into the TRE for agent development.

### 2. Leverage VITAL/GEMINI Precedent

VITAL and GEMINI already demonstrate this federated model:
- Population-scale analytics run inside AHS infrastructure
- Aggregate outputs feed external research
- Snowflake provides the computation layer

**Suggested text**: "The In Silico Assessment Agent extends VITAL/GEMINI's proven architecture from retrospective analytics to prospective trial intelligence. While patient-level queries remain within AHS's governance perimeter, the TRE hosts agent development, model refinement, and the protocol optimization interface that researchers interact with."

### 3. Highlight the Differentiating Value

Suggested additions to the RTA:

**Strategic positioning** (for Need/Rationale section):
> "CTAP's In Silico Assessment Agent represents Canada's first prospective trial intelligence capability—transforming population-scale EMR data from evidence after the fact into decision support before execution. This addresses the most common cause of trial failure: over-optimistic eligibility assumptions that lead to under-enrollment."

**Quantifiable impact** (for Objectives):
> "Enable protocol stress-testing that reduces trial failure rates by identifying feasibility issues before IRB submission. Industry partners report 40-60% of trials fail to meet enrollment targets; In Silico Assessment can pre-screen protocols against Alberta's actual population to validate assumptions."

**Competitive differentiation**:
> "No Canadian jurisdiction offers prospective trial feasibility simulation at population scale. International comparators (UK Biobank RAP, All of Us) focus on retrospective analytics; CTAP's In Silico capability positions Alberta as a trial design optimization authority."

### 4. Feasibility Statements to Add

1. **Infrastructure readiness**: "VITAL and GEMINI demonstrate that population-scale analytics within AHS infrastructure are operationally feasible. The In Silico Agent extends this proven architecture with a new analytical layer."

2. **Governance pathway**: "The agent operates on aggregate outputs from AHS-managed queries, not patient-level data. This maintains AHS data custodianship while enabling trial intelligence capabilities."

3. **TRL progression**: "The agent begins at TRL 3 (research prototype) with a defined 3-year path to TRL 6 (prototype validated) through CVC pilot trials. Validation benchmarks include retrospective prediction accuracy against completed trial enrollment data."

4. **Staged deployment**: "Year 1-2: Develop feasibility query engine on historical trial data. Year 3-4: Prospective validation on active CVC trials. Year 5+: Integration with industry sponsor trial design workflows."

### 5. TRE Integration Points

Even with AHS-managed population data, the TRE adds value:

| TRE Component | In Silico Agent Function |
|---------------|--------------------------|
| Zone 3 compute | Agent training on aggregate outputs |
| OMOP CDM | Standardized feature definitions for feasibility queries |
| GPU cluster | LLM-based protocol interpretation, query generation |
| Audit logging | Regulatory-grade query provenance |
| Researcher workspaces | Interactive protocol optimization interface |
| Airlock controls | Ensures only aggregates leave AHS perimeter |

### 6. Connect to SCA Synergy

The In Silico Agent and SCA share infrastructure:
- Same patient representations and feature engineering
- Same OMOP CDM foundation
- Same governance framework

But serve different purposes:
- **SCA**: "What likely happened compared to no treatment?" (retrospective)
- **In Silico**: "What will happen if we run this trial?" (prospective)

This dual capability from shared infrastructure is a compelling efficiency argument.
