# Suite 2: Emphasize Reverse Data Flow (AI-Triggered Sample Retrieval)

## Source
CFI-CTAP Grant Proposal Review (Antigravity Agent, January 2026)

## Priority
HIGH

## Context
Reviewer rates Suite 2 as "Very Strong" with compelling "Discovery Engine" concept, but recommends emphasizing bidirectional data flow.

## Recommendation
Not just "Sample → Data," but "Data → Sample."

**Quote from review:**
> "Explain how the AI agents in Suite 4 will trigger automated retrieval or processing instructions in Suite 2 based on EMR changes (e.g., 'Patient admitted → Robot pulls sample'). This 'active' biorepository concept differentiates from standard 'storage.'"

## Actions Required
1. **Add "Reverse Flow" section** to Suite 2 description showing:
   - Connect Care event triggers
   - AI agent-initiated sample actions
   - Automated processing workflows

2. **Example Use Cases**:
   - **Trial Safety Event**: Patient hospitalized → Events Agent detects → Biorepository receives pull request → Sample prepared for toxicology analysis
   - **Outcome Correlation**: Patient reaches primary endpoint → Protocol Agent notifies → Biorepository queues sample for post-hoc analysis
   - **Adaptive Trial**: Interim analysis shows subgroup benefit → CRAIDL identifies biomarker hypothesis → Biorepository retrieves relevant samples

3. **Technical Implementation**:
   - OpenSpecimen API for programmatic sample retrieval
   - FHIR subscription for Connect Care events
   - Workflow engine connecting TRE analytics to biorepository actions

## Suggested Text
> **Active Biorepository Architecture:** Unlike passive storage, the Living Biorepository operates bidirectionally. Suite 4's AI agents can trigger sample-level actions based on clinical events. When Connect Care records a hospitalization for a trial participant, the Events Agent automatically generates a sample retrieval request, queuing the specimen for urgent toxicology analysis. When interim analysis identifies a pharmacogenomic signal, the Protocol Agent can request targeted sample pulls for validation testing. This transforms the biorepository from an archive into a research-responsive system.
