# Suite 4: Strengthen AWS TRE Feasibility with Assessment Metrics

## Source
CFI-CTAP Grant Proposal Review (Antigravity Agent, January 2026)

## Priority
MEDIUM

## Context
Reviewer rates Suite 4 as "Excellent" with robust Three-Zone architecture, but recommends including more specific metrics from the AWS TRE Assessment.

## Recommendation
Include more metrics on the "AWS TRE Assessment" to prove readiness.

## Actions Required
1. **Review AWS TRE Assessment document** (background/UAlberta_AWS_TRE_Assessment.md)
2. **Extract key readiness metrics**:
   - Security controls validated
   - Compliance certifications confirmed
   - Performance benchmarks
   - Cost projections

3. **Add metrics to Suite 4 description**:
   - "AWS Canada Central region certified for HIA compliance"
   - "TRE provisioning time: <24 hours from approved project"
   - "Cost per researcher workspace: $X/month"
   - "Data transfer speeds: X GB/hour secure ingress"

4. **For In Silico Agent**: Clarify data volume requirements
   - Specify minimum dataset size for Digital Twin training
   - e.g., "We need Suite 2's 100,000 samples to train the Digital Twin"
   - This justifies Suite interdependence
