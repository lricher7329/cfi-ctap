# Overview

!include ../includes/suite_1_description.md

# Strategic Context

Suite 1 provides the foundational clinical infrastructure that enables CTAP to conduct complex trials safely and efficiently. Without purpose-built procedure spaces, monitoring equipment, and pharmacy infrastructure, advanced therapy trials (cell therapies, biologics, vaccines) cannot proceed.

Key differentiators include:
- Canada's first academic **Vaccine Challenge Trial Unit**—a controlled human infection model (CHIM) facility supporting Dr. Michael Houghton's (Nobel laureate 2020) Hepatitis C vaccine program and pandemic preparedness
- A dedicated **Pediatric Rare Disease Clinical Trials Unit** at the Stollery Children's Hospital, serving as the Western anchor for the national RareKids-CAN network
