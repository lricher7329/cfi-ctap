# Overview

!include ../includes/suite_5_description.md

# Strategic Context

Suite 5 enables CTAP to reach underserved populations—Indigenous communities, rural Albertans, and pediatric patients—through decentralized trial approaches. This infrastructure supports CTAP's equity commitments: 15% Indigenous participation, 20% rural participation, and patient-centered trial designs.

# Target Populations

| Population | Current Barrier | CTAP Solution |
|------------|-----------------|---------------|
| **Indigenous communities** | Geographic distance, cultural concerns | Remote telehealth, culturally safe protocols |
| **Rural Alberta** | Travel burden, limited access | Wearables, decentralized data capture |
| **Pediatric patients** | Family logistics, school schedules | Mobile consent, home-based monitoring |
| **Elderly patients** | Mobility challenges | Telehealth visits, wearable monitoring |

# Equipment List

| Item | Quantity | Est. Cost |
|------|----------|-----------|
| Enterprise eConsent platform | 1 | $200,000 |
| Mobile devices for consent/capture | 80 | $160,000 |
| Clinic kiosks | 10 | $80,000 |
| ECG patch monitors | 100 | $100,000 |
| Blood pressure monitors | 100 | $50,000 |
| Actigraphy devices | 50 | $75,000 |
| Remote telehealth kits | 20 | $200,000 |
| Data visualization dashboards | 1 | $150,000 |
| Integration development | - | $115,000 |
| **Total** | | **$1,130,000** |

# Objectives Supported

- **Objective 2**: Indigenous (15%) and rural (20%) recruitment targets
- **Objective 5**: AI-enabled consent generation via CRAIDL Ethics Agent
- **Objective 7**: Training HQP in decentralized trial methods

# Decentralized Trial Model

**Traditional Trial:**
```
Patient → Travel → Clinic → Scheduled Visit → Manual Data Entry
```

**CTAP Decentralized Trial:**
```
Patient → eConsent (home) → Wearable Data (continuous) →
Telehealth Check-in → Automated Integration → Connect Care Linkage
```

# Indigenous Engagement

CTAP will develop decentralized trial capabilities in partnership with:
- Indigenous Health Advisory Council
- First Nations, Métis, and Inuit communities
- Indigenous data sovereignty frameworks

All remote trial tools will be developed with cultural safety principles, including:
- Consent materials in Indigenous languages where appropriate
- Community-based research coordinator training
- Respect for Indigenous data governance

# Key Personnel

| Role | Responsibility |
|------|----------------|
| Indigenous Engagement Lead | Community partnerships |
| Decentralized Trials Coordinator | Remote operations |
| Clinical Informatics Specialist | Wearable data integration |
| Patient Experience Officer | Accessibility and usability |

# Next Steps

1. Engage Indigenous Health Advisory Council for co-design
2. Pilot eConsent platform with patient partners
3. Establish telehealth kit deployment protocol
4. Develop wearable data integration with trial databases
