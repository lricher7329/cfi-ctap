## Key Messages for Letter

The letter should address the following partnership elements formalized through a proposed MOU (see RTA Section 2.2.1):

### 1. Manufacturing Partnership Commitment

API confirms its commitment to a formal partnership with CTAP establishing:
- Coordinated trial-to-manufacturing pathway (DDIC → CTAP trials → CMPC scale-up)
- Shared workforce development initiatives (GMP training rotations)
- Data integration for QSP model refinement
- Joint regulatory strategy development

### 2. Specific CTAP-API Workflow Endorsement

The letter should describe the operational workflow:

| Stage | API Role | CTAP Role |
|-------|----------|-----------|
| Phase I | DDIC provides investigational formulations (cGMP small batches) | CIU conducts first-in-human studies |
| Phase II/III | CMPC provides scale-up manufacturing | Multi-site trial coordination |
| Post-Market | CMPC production | Real-world evidence collection |

### 3. Data Integration

Confirmation of willingness to participate in bidirectional data flows:
- CTAP trial outcomes (de-identified) → API QSP division for model refinement
- Manufacturing batch QC data → CTAP Living Biorepository for outcome correlation

### 4. Governance Integration

Agreement to Manufacturing Advisor role on CTAP Scientific Advisory Board (observer status)

### 5. National Significance

Position this partnership as completing Canada's only integrated discovery→manufacturing→clinical validation→production pathway, aligned with:
- Federal Biomanufacturing and Life Sciences Strategy ($2.2B, 2021-2028)
- PRAIRIE Hub pandemic preparedness infrastructure
- Canadian Critical Drug Initiative (CCDI) objectives

## Draft Opening Sentence for Request Email

> Dear Andrew,
>
> The University of Alberta is preparing a major CFI Innovation Fund 2027 application for the Clinical Trials Acceleration Platform (CTAP) - a $23M infrastructure initiative that will establish Alberta as Canada's leader in clinical trials. Given API's central role in Alberta's biomanufacturing ecosystem, we would like to formalize our partnership through the application and request a letter of support.
>
> CTAP is designed to serve as the "clinical validation engine" that connects PRAIRIE Hub discoveries and API manufacturing to patient benefit. The application includes a dedicated section on our biomanufacturing integration partnership (see attached), and we believe this positions both organizations for continued success in Canada's growing life sciences sector.
