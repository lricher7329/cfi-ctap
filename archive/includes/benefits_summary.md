CTAP will generate significant social, economic, health, and innovation benefits for Canadians:

**Health and Social Benefits:**
- Faster access to therapies: AI-assisted processes reduce eligibility screening time by 78% and transform patient identification from months to minutes
- Alberta patients gain earlier access to novel therapies and more opportunities to participate in high-quality trials
- Indigenous and rural communities benefit from co-designed, culturally safe, and geographically accessible trials with explicit enrollment targets (15% Indigenous, 20% rural)

**Cloud as Equity Enabler:**
- Cloud-based TRE eliminates geographic hierarchies—a researcher in Fort McMurray or a clinical site in Nunavut accesses the same infrastructure as the University of Alberta
- Store-and-forward data synchronization works with intermittent connectivity; telehealth kits capture data during available bandwidth windows
- Voice-first AI Scribe reduces transcription burden that connectivity-dependent systems impose
- OCAP-compliant governance ensures improved northern connectivity strengthens rather than threatens Indigenous data sovereignty
- Data remains in Canadian jurisdiction (AWS Calgary region) under Canadian law

**Economic and Innovation Benefits:**
- Strengthens Alberta's position as an international technology and innovation hub, directly supporting ATIS goals
- Attracts industry R&D from pharmaceutical partners, biotech developers, and external academics seeking AI-augmented trial design efficiency
- Generates new IP in AI algorithms for trial design, analytical pipelines, and platform technologies
- Trains HQP at the intersection of clinical research, data science, AI, and biomanufacturing

**Knowledge Mobilization:**
- CRAIDL agents developed using open-source architecture for deployment across ACT-AEC network nationally and internationally
- Rapid dissemination through open-access publications, clinical guidelines, and care pathway integration
- As Western anchor for ACT-AEC, PRAIRIE Hub, and RareKids-CAN, CTAP multiplies impact through shared protocols, federated data access, and coordinated training
