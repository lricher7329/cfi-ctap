Alberta possesses a convergence of advantages that cannot be easily replicated:

**Unrivalled AI Capacity:** The Alberta Machine Intelligence Institute (Amii), with over 10 CIFAR AI Chairs focused on health and life sciences and leadership that includes pioneers of modern reinforcement learning, provides in-house expertise to deploy AI directly into clinical workflows—without outsourcing.

**A Unified Health System:** Alberta's single-payer system, underpinned by Connect Care—a province-wide Epic-based clinical information system spanning 682 sites and serving 4.4 million Albertans—provides computable access to longitudinal records for population-scale research. No other Canadian province has this combination of scale, integration, and data accessibility.

**Mature Discovery Infrastructure:** Over $400M in cumulative investment—including the $20M Alberta Cryo-EM Facility (only one in Alberta, 1 of 5 in Canada), national-scale TMIC metabolomics (50K samples/year), and the Glycomics Institute of Alberta—creates an unmatched bench-to-trials ecosystem. These world-class discovery assets currently lack a unified downstream pathway to human validation. CTAP provides that pathway.

**Expanding Biomanufacturing Capacity:** Alberta is rapidly becoming a national hub through the Critical Medicines Production Centre ($200M, 70M+ doses/year by 2026), PRAIRIE Hub ($109.9M), and operational Alberta Cell Therapy Manufacturing.

**The Unique Combination:** Few centres globally combine GMP manufacturing, deep structural and systems biology, national-scale omics, a top-tier AI institute with CIFAR Chairs, a mature academic trials organization with 50+ trial templates, and a single-payer provincial health system with province-wide EMR—into a single clinical trials platform.
